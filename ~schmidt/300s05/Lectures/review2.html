<h2>Review information for CIS300 Exam 2</h2>

The exam will be held at 1:30-2:20pm, Monday, April 11, in
Thompson 101.  It will worth about 28 points.

<h4>
Materials:</h4>
Please bring your own pencils and blank paper for writing your
answers.  You may also bring one 8.5" by 11" sheet of paper upon which
you may write and reproduce notes to help you
answer the exam questions.

<p>
You are <em>not</em> allowed to use a computer, handheld calculator,
or other electronic device to help answer the exam questions.

<h4>Exam format:</h4>
The exam will emphasize programming skills, so be ready to write Java
code for
the bodies of specified methods or to complete an almost-finished
Java method or class.


<h4>Exam content:</h4>

The exam covers the material presented in Weeks 6-10 of lectures
and Programming Assignments 5 and 6. 

<p>
The key parts of this material are:
<ol>
<li>
How to use  <tt>class Cell</tt> to build a linked list.
<li>
How to use <tt>class Cell</tt> to implement <tt>class Stack</tt> and
<tt>class Queue</tt> and to write methods that operate on the
list representation of stacks and queues. 
<li>
How to write basic operations on linked lists, e.g.,
count the number of cells in a linked list; print the value held
in the first cell of a list; print out the value held in the last
cell of a list; add a new cell to the front or rear of a list.
<li>
How to convert an inductive definition of a tree into
appropriate Java classes.
<li>
How to write basic operations on a binary tree, e.g., count the number
of nodes, print the values held in the tree's nodes.
</ol>

<p>
Also, on Tuesday morning, April 5, I will post
<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Assign/Assn6Soln">here</a> a solution to Programming Assignment 6.  This might
prove helpful for preparing for the exam.

<p>
The exam will <tt>not</tt> include questions on
doubly linked lists and on writing recursively defined methods that
process linked lists.  But you are expected to know how to
write recursively defined methods for processing
binary trees.  The exam will <em>not</em> include questions about
``parent links'' in binary trees.
