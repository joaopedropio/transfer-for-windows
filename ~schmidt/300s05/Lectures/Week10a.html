<h2>Spelling Trees</h2>

Some people call
a data structure a
<em>dictionary</em>
if it is a collection of ``words,'' and it has methods for inserting and
finding specific words in the collection.

<p>
If a ``word'' is a sequence of characters, or in general, a sequence (or list)
whose elements can be ordered, then
there is a clever implementation of a dictionary as a so-called
<em>spelling tree</em>
or <em>trie</em> (pronounced ``try'').
For example, say that we have some objects, 
<tt>o1, o2, o3, o4,</tt> and <tt>o5</tt>, and say that the respective
keys of these objects are the
the words, <em>be, bed, bee, been,</em> and <em>it</em>.
We can organize the objects so that each key defines a path
from the root of the tree to the node that holds the object:
<pre>
               null
           b/       \i
          null      null
          e|         |t
          o1        o5
        d/ e\  
        o2  o3 
             |n
            o4
</pre>
For example, object <tt>o1</tt>, whose key is <tt>be</tt>,
is found by traversing the path
labelled <tt>b</tt> followed by <tt>e</tt>.
Notice that object <tt>o2</tt>, whose key is <tt>bed</tt>,
is located by following the path labelled
<tt>b</tt> then <tt>e</tt>, then <tt>d</tt>.

<p>
For completeness sake, some paths lead to nodes where there are no values;
such nodes hold ``null''.  For example, the key, <tt>i</tt>, leads to a
node that holds null.
Notice that the ``leaves'' in the drawing are nodes that do not
hold (links to) more nodes. 

<p>
The labels on the branches replace the usual labels (fields)
named ``left'' and ``right,'' and a Node may have some nonnegative
quantity of subtrees.  For this
reason, a spelling tree is an example of an ``n-ary'' tree, where
the value of <em>n</em> is a nonnegative number.
(Of course, a binary tree is a 2-ary tree.)

<p>
Note that
<ul>
<li>
Insertions take time that is linear in the length of the key,
and there is no limit to the quantity of keyed objects that
can be inserted.  

<p>
<li>
Assuming that each object that might ever be
stored in the tree has a unique key, and assuming that the symbols in
the keys are chosen from an alphabet of size <tt>M</tt>, and assuming
that there are <tt>N</tt> such objects with unique keys, then we
note that the longest path in a spelling tree is equal to the longest
key, which has length <tt>log<sub>M</sub>(N)</tt>.

<p>
This implies that insertions and lookups in a spelling tree take time
on the order of <tt>log<sub>M</sub>(N)</tt>, which is roughly equivalent
to the time taken to do insertions in lookups in a binary tree,
where <tt>M = 2</tt>.   (For some intuition, calculate the values of
<tt>log<sub>M</sub>(N)</tt>, for these ranges of <tt>M</tt> and <tt>N</tt>:
<br>
<tt>M = 2 or 10</tt>;
<tt>N = 32 or 100 or 1000 or 10000</tt>.)
</ul>

<p>
In practice, spelling trees are often preferred over binary trees to store
keyed objects, because it is easy to work directly with the symbols within
the keys.  But we will see that the implementation becomes slightly more
complicated.

<h4>Designing Spelling Trees</h4>

To make the previous drawing of a spelling tree come to life, we
use a fixed
<em>alphabet</em> for the keys (e.g., the characters <tt>'a'</tt> through
<tt>'z'</tt>).  
Then, the inductive data type definition for a spelling tree might be
written like this:
<em>
<dl>
<dd>
A SpellingTree object is
<ol>
<li>
A Node object, which contains
<ul>
<li>
a Value
<li>
a set of SpellingTree objects (which might be empty),
where each spelling-tree object is labelled by a symbol of the alphabet.
</ul>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<dl>
<dd>
A Value is either:
<ol>
<li>an object, called the ``value'', or
<li>empty (also known as ``null'')
</ol>
</dl>
</em>
That is, a spelling tree is a node that holds/links to other
spelling trees.

<p>
The above inductive definition is not the only way to define the data type
of spelling trees.

<h4>Implementing Spelling Trees</h4>

The inductive definition gives us a strong hint how to build a
spelling tree:  <tt>class Node</tt> would hold (the addresses of)
a set of spelling trees, plus a ``value'' (which is an object or <tt>null</tt>).

<p>
There are many ways to model sets, but since the set of spelling trees
are indexed by letters of the alphabet, an array implementation works
well.
For the example tree above, the root Node object
might look like this in heap storage:
<pre>
   a1 : Node
   ---------------------------------
   |  value ==| null |
   |           ------
   |             'a'  'b'  'c'  ...   'i'  ...   'z' 
   |            ------------------------------------
   |  subtree: |null| a2 |null| ... | a3 | ... |null|
   |            ------------------------------------
   |
</pre>
<tt>subtree</tt> is an array whose indexes are the letters of the
alphabet used to form keys.  (Unfortunately, Java does not allow
letters to be array indices, so you must do a conversion when you code
the array.)
Since the root has one subtree indexed by <tt>'b'</tt> and one
subtree indexed by <tt>'i'</tt>, there are nonnull addresses to the
Node objects for these two subtrees. 

<p>
Next, the node indexed by <tt>'b'</tt> looks like this:
<pre>
   a2 : Node
   ---------------------------------
   |  value ==| null |
   |           ------
   |             'a'  'b'  'c'  'd'   'e'  ...   'z' 
   |            ------------------------------------
   |  subtree: |null|null|null| null | a4 | ... |null|
   |            ------------------------------------
   |
</pre>
and its subtree indexed by <tt>'e'</tt> looks like this:
<pre>
   a4 : Node
   ---------------------------------
   |  value ==| o1 |
   |           ------
   |             'a'  'b'  'c'  'd'  'e'  ...   'z' 
   |            ------------------------------------
   |  subtree: |null|null|null| a5 | a6 | ... |null|
   |            ------------------------------------
   |
</pre>

<p>
The main advantage of using an array to label the subtrees is that
key processing is fast (because array lookup is fast).
The main disadvantage is that a huge alphabet requires huge arrays
within each node---this is a major loss if the array holds mostly
null addresses.

<p>
When the alphabet is huge or not fixed, a linked list can be used
to save the subtrees for a given Node (but this can make key lookup
much slower).
