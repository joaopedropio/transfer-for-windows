<h1>The activation-record stack</h1>

Almost every programming language that contains procedures or methods
in its vocabulary is implemented with a stack structure,
and this is also the case with Java.

<p>
The earlier lecture on execution semantics showed how objects are
constructed within a process's storage partition.   But the presentation
in that lecture simplified the semantics of method call --- the lecture
showed the code of an invoked method
``copied'' into the object that was
the target of the invocation.  In reality, no code is copied into objects;
instead, an <em>activation record</em> is constructed
and pushed onto the process's <em>activation record stack</em>.

<p>
First, recall that a program's storage partition looks like this:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/layout2.jpg">
</pre>
The storage used for data will be used to build a
stack at the ``left end,'' and objects will be constructed at the ``right end.''
When a program's 
<tt>main</tt> method is started, the partition looks like this:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/layout3.jpg">
</pre>
A record for <tt>main</tt> is pushed onto the activation record stack;
the record holds cells for <tt>main</tt>'s local variables and the return
address to which the JVM should jump when <tt>main</tt> finishes.
Say that <tt>main</tt> calls a method, <tt>p</tt>.  Then, an activation record
holding
<tt>p</tt>'s local variables and return address is pushed onto the stack:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/layout4.jpg">
</pre>
If <tt>p</tt> calls <tt>q</tt>, the same happens:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/layout5.jpg">
</pre>
The pictures show us that

<strong>
<ul>
<li>
the activation-record stack <em>remembers the history of incompleted
method calls</em>, and
<li>
the topmost activation record <em>holds the data
values for the currently executing method.</em>
</ul>
</strong>

<p>
When <tt>q</tt> finishes, its activation record is popped, and the
configuation reverts to
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/layout4.jpg">
</pre>
Now, <tt>p</tt> can finish its execution from the point where it paused to
invoke <tt>q</tt>.  When <tt>p</tt> finishes, its record is popped,
and <tt>main</tt> can finish.

<p>
Now we study an example to see how this concept applies to 
methods associated with objects.


<h3>An example</h3>

Here is a small Java application:
<pre>
public class Controller
{ public static void main(...)
  { int x = 2;
    Model m = new Model();
    m.set(x+1);
    System.out.println( m.get() );
} }


public class Model
{ private int val;

  public Model() { val = 0; }

  public void set(int w)
  { Model x = new Model();
    val = w; }

  public int get() { return val; }
}
</pre>
When the Java compiler checks these two classes and translates them into .class
files, it makes some small but crucial changes;
the changes are marked by <tt>//!</tt>:
<pre>
public class Controller
{ public static void main(...)
  { int x = 2;
    Model m = new Model();
    m.set(x+1);
    System.out.println( m.get() );
    return;  //!
  } }


public class Model
{ private int val;

  public Model()
  { this.val = 0;  //!
    return this;   //!
  }

  public void set(int w)
  { Model x = new Model();
    this.val = w;  //!
    return;  //!
  }

  public int get()
  { return this.val; } //!
}
</pre>
First, every method is ended with an explicit <tt>return</tt> statement,
which clarifies when control leaves the method and returns to the method's
caller.  Second, within each class, references to the class's fields
(attributes) are prefixed by <tt>this</tt>.  When we study the example's
execution semantics, we will see that <tt>this</tt> is an extra local variable
that helps associate method code with the object that the method manipulates.

<p>
In the previous lecture, we learned that the Java compiler next
reformats the code into posfix notation and then into byte code.
Because byte code is difficult for humans to read, we will not use
the byte-code versions of the two example classes in the example
that follows.

<p>
When the program is started (<tt>java Controller</tt>),
the JVM and <tt>java.lang</tt> are loaded
into the partition.  Then, <tt>Controller.class</tt> and
<tt>Model.class</tt> are loaded, and the controller's
<tt>main</tt> method is started: an activation record for
<tt>main</tt> is pushed onto the activation-record stack:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1a.jpg">
</pre>
As noted earlier, <tt>main</tt>'s record holds cells for its two local
variables, <tt>x</tt> and <tt>m</tt>, as well as the return address of
where execution should continue when <tt>main</tt> finishes and returns.

<p>
The first instruction that executes, at address 102, saves 2 in
<tt>x</tt>'s cell:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1b.jpg">
</pre>
The next instruction, at address 103, constructs a new <tt>Model</tt>
object.  Several steps must be performed:
<ol>
<li>
A <tt>Model</tt> object is constructed in heap storage, and a cell
for its private variable, <tt>val</tt>, is allocated therein.
<li>
The object's constructor method is immediately executed.
<li>
The address of the newly constructed object is returned as the result
of executing the constructor method.  
</ol>

The picture below shows Step 1: The object is constructed, a cell is
allocated for its variable, <tt>val</tt>, and
its constructor method is started. (The instruction counter in the
JVM is reset to 202, the first instruction in the constructor method.) 

<p>
The constructor method's activation record is pushed onto the stack.
It holds cells for the method's local variables (in this case, none),
and it holds the return address back to <tt>main</tt>'s code.
It holds an additional cell, <tt>this</tt>, which <em>holds the address
of the newly constructed object</em>.

<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1c.jpg">
</pre>
The picture shows that <em>no code is copied into the <tt>Model</tt> object</em> --- the code
stays where it is, and the instruction counter holds the code's address.

<p>
Now, we learn why the Java compiler reformatted the assignment,
<tt>val = 0</tt>, into <tt>this.val = 0</tt>.
The value of variable, <tt>this</tt>, is found within the topmost record
of the activation-record stack --- the value is 500.
Hence, it is the <tt>val</tt> variable within the object at address 500
that must be assigned zero:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1d.jpg">
</pre>
The <tt>this</tt> variable removes the need to copy method code into
objects.

<p>
Now, it is time to return from the constructor method.
The <tt>return this</tt> instruction causes the value in the
return-address cell to be copied into the instruction counter and
also the value in <tt>this</tt>'s cell to be returned to its destination
in <tt>main</tt>.  (In reality, the value of <tt>this</tt> is copied
into a register in the CPU and later it is copied into <tt>main</tt>'s variable
<tt>m</tt>.)
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1e.jpg">
</pre>
The activation record for the constructor method
is erased.

<p>
Now, the assignment to <tt>m</tt> is completed:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1f.jpg">
</pre>

<p>
Next, it is time to execute the method invocation,
<tt>m.set(x+1)</tt>.  The evaluation of the invocation proceeds
from left to right:
<ol>
<li>
determine the target object's (<tt>m</tt>'s) address.
(Here, it is 500.)
<li>
determine the value of the argument (actual parameter).
Here, it is <tt>3</tt>.
<li>
start the invoked method.
</ol>
Steps 1 and 2 are shown below:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1g.jpg">
</pre>

And here is the start of Step 3 --- an activation record for
method <tt>set</tt> is pushed, where its <tt>this</tt> variable is
initialized to
500.  Notice that its argument
is saved in the variable for formal parameter, <tt>w</tt>.
And, the return address is saved.
The instruction counter is reset to the first instruction within the
invoked method:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1h.jpg">
</pre>

The next instruction constructs a second <tt>Model</tt>
object, and the steps seen a moment ago are repeated.
We see a new object constructed and fresh activation record pushed
for <tt>Model</tt>'s constructor method:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1j.jpg">
</pre>
The constructor executes as seen before, using the same instructions
as before, but since <tt>this</tt>'s cell holds 600, the new object
is correctly initialized.  The constructor returns its address
to its caller, and its activation record disappears:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1k.jpg">
</pre>
Because the execution has returned to the code for <tt>set</tt>,
and because the topmost activation record holds the variables for <tt>set</tt>,
variable <tt>x</tt> is correctly assigned:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1l.jpg">
</pre>
and the correct <tt>val</tt> field is reset:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1m.jpg">
</pre>
Now, <tt>set</tt> is finished, and execution returns to <tt>main</tt>:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/ex1n.jpg">
</pre>
Notice that the object at address 600 still rests in storage, even
though it is impossible for the application to reference it;
the object is <em>garbage</em>,  and at a later point in the execution,
the <em>garbage collector</em> program within the JVM will examine all
of storage and erase all such unreachable objects.  (In contrast,
languages like C and C++ lack garbage collectors, and the programmer
must insert code to explictly erase unneeded objects.)

<p>
The next instruction,
<tt>System.out.println(m.get())</tt>, triggers an invocation of
<tt>get</tt> whose <tt>this</tt> cell holds 500.  Once <tt>get</tt>
returns 3, the <tt>println</tt> method is invoked.
This finishes the application's execution.

<h3>The temporary-value stack</h3>

The previous example emphasized how the activation-record stack
remembers the local variables and return address for each method that is
invoked.   But within a method, there might be instructions that
compute arithmetic expressions.    We saw in the earlier lecture that
arithmetic expressions are computed with the assistance of a stack;
the stack that holds arithmetic values is called
the <em>temporary-value stack</em>.

<p>
Although it was not drawn in the above diagrams, each activation
record holds its own temporary-value stack for computing arithmetic.
If we examine the precise structure of a method's activation record,
we would find this:
<pre>
<img src="ActRecordEx/record.jpg">
</pre>
The temporary-value stack literally grows ``out of the right end''
of the activation record; this lets the temporary-value stack grow
as needed to evaluate complicated arithmetic expressions.
When a function is invoked in the middle of evaluating a complex
arithmetic expression, the activation record for the invoked function
is constructed just as if it is resting  ``on the top'' of the temporary
value stack.  This makes it easy to return from the invoked function
and finish evaluating the expression.
