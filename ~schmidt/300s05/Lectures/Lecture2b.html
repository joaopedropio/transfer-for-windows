<h2>Adding Java Interfaces to the Database Example</h2>

From
the case study, we learned these crucial points:
<ol>
<li>
Databases have operations (methods) for insertion, lookup, and deletion
of <tt>Record</tt>s, where each record owns a unique <tt>Key</tt>.
<li>
<tt>class Database</tt> is coded with no knowledge about the internal
structure of <tt>Record</tt>s and <tt>Key</tt>s.  
<li>
Later, we write specific versions of <tt>class Record</tt> and
<tt>class Key</tt> to model bank accounts and their id numbers,
or library books and their catalog numbers, or whatever we wish.
</ol>
The reason why Item 2 holds true is because we assume that,
whatever a <tt>class Record</tt> or <tt>class Key</tt> might be,
they have these operations:
<p>
<table BORDER CELLPADDING=5  >

<tr>
<td>
<tt>Record</tt>
</td>
<td>
a data item that can be stored in a database
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Methods
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>getKey(): Key</tt>
</td>
<td>
Returns the key that uniquely identifies the record.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<table BORDER CELLPADDING=5  >

<tr>
<td>
<tt>Key</tt>
</td>
<td>
an identification, or ``key,'' value
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Methods
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>equals(Key m): boolean</tt>
</td>
<td>
Compares itself to another key, <tt>m</tt>, for equality.  If this key
and <tt>m</tt> are
same key value, then <tt>true</tt> is returned;
if <tt>m</tt> is a different key value, then <tt>false</tt>
is returned.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

Later, we write codings of records and keys that have these operations.

<p>
As noted at the end of the case study, the development of
<tt>class Database</tt> isn't quite perfect:  With the current coding:
<ul>
<li>
Whatever we code for the records, albeit bank accounts, books, people,
or stamps, we must name it <tt>class Record</tt>.  (There is the same
problem for all forms of key, which all must be named <tt>class Key</tt>.)
This is unnatural and will
cause big trouble when we try to use more than one form of record or
key in the same program!
<li>
We cannot place <tt>class Database</tt> in a package by itself and save
it for later use, because it refers to <tt>class Record</tt> and
<tt>class Key</tt>, and these classes are not yet written.
</ul>
We can repair these problems with the help of Java <tt>interface</tt>s.


<p>
Figure 5 shows how to transform the descriptions of
<tt>Record</tt> and <tt>Key</tt> into Java
<tt>interface</tt>s.
<pre>FIGURE 5: interfaces for Record and Key===============================

package DB;
/** Record is a data item that can be stored in a database  */
public interface Record
{ /** getKey returns the key that uniquely identifies the record
    * @return the key  */
  public Key getKey();     // NOTICE THE SEMICOLON---IT IS REQUIRED!
}


package DB;
/** Key is an identification, or ``key,'' value   */
public interface Key
{ /** equals  compares itself to another key, m, for equality
    * @param m - the other key
    * @return true, if this key and  m  have the same key value;
    *  return false, otherwise  */
  public boolean equals(Key m);  // NOTICE THE SEMICOLON---IT IS REQUIRED!
}

ENDFIGURE=============================================================</pre>
These interfaces are placed in the same package (folder) as 
<tt>class Database</tt>, and all three are compiled together.
(Say that the package is named,  <tt>package DB</tt>, as used in
Figure 5 above.  Of course this means that <tt>class Database</tt>
is slightly altered so that it reads
<pre>
package DB;
public class Database
{ ... }
</pre>
)

<p>
Note again how <tt>class Database</tt>
refers to <tt>Record</tt> and <tt>Key</tt> in its fields and
methods.   Now, the Java compiler will understand that the names
<tt>Record</tt> and <tt>Key</tt> are names of interfaces --- connection
points --- to classes that will be written later and will implement
the interfaces.

<p>
Here is a class diagram of <tt>package DB</tt>:
<pre>
<img src="DatabaseExample/db0.gif">
</pre>


<p>
Now we are ready to use the database in an application.
Perhaps we are building a cataloguing program for a library,
so we wish to implement a database that holds records about books.
We can write another package, say, <tt>package Library</tt>,
that holds records about books and keys that are catalog numbers.
Here are the codings of the records and keys:
<pre>FIGURE 6: implementing the database's interfaces==========================

package Library;
import DB;  // needed so that we can refer to the  Record  interface
/** Book models a Library Book */
public class Book implements Record
{ private Key catalog_number;
  private String title;
  private String author;
  private int publication_date;

  /** Constructor Book constructs the book's record
    * @param num - the book's catalog number
    * @param a - the book's author
    * @param t - the book's title   */
  public Book(Key num, String a, String t, int date)
  { catalog_number = num;
    title = t;
    author = a;
    publication_date = date;
  }

  /** getkey  returns the key that identifies the record
    * @return the key  */
  public Key getKey() { return catalog_number; }

  /** getTitle returns the book's title
    * @return the title */
  public String getTitle() { return title; }

  /** getAuthor returns the book's author
    * @return the author */
  public String getAuthor() { return author; }

  /** getDate returns the book's publication date
    * @return the date */
  public int getDate() { return publication_date; }
}


package Library;
import DB;
/** CatalogNumber models a Library-of-Congress-style id number,
  *  consisting of a letter sequence and a decimal number, e.g., QA76.884  */
public class CatalogNumber implements Key
{ private String letter_code;  // the letter code, e.g.,  "QA"
  private double number_code;  // the number code, e.g.,  76.884

  /** Constructor CatalogNumber constructs a catalog number
    * @param letters - the letter code, e.g.,  "QA"
    * @param num - the decimal number code, e.g.,  76.884 */
  public CatalogNumber(String letters, double num)
  { letter_code = letters;
    number_code = num;
  }

  /** equals returns whether the catalog number held within this object
    *  is identical to the catalog number held within  c
    * @param c - the other catalog number
    * @return true, if this catalog number equals  c; return false, otherwise */
  public boolean equals(Key c)
  { String s = ((CatalogNumber)c).getLetterCode();
    double d = ((CatalogNumber)c).getNumberCode();
    return ( s.equals(letter_code)  &&  d == number_code );
  }

  /** getLetterCode returns the letter code part of this catalog number
    * @return the letter code, e.g.,  "QA"  */
  public String getLetterCode() { return letter_code; }

  /** getNumberCode returns the number code part of this catalog number
    * @return the number code, e.g.,  "76.884"  */
  public double getNumberCode() { return number_code; }
}


ENDFIGURE============================================================</pre>

Note that
<ul>
<li>
<tt>class Book implements Record</tt>,
<tt>class CatalogNumber implements Key</tt>.
This ``connects'' the two classes to the two interfaces, and it means
that <tt>Book</tt> objects may be inserted into a <tt>Database</tt>
object.
<li>
Both <tt>class Book</tt> and <tt>class CatalogNumber</tt> are
listed as belonging to another package, <tt>package Library</tt>.
<li>
Both classes must <tt>import DB</tt> so that the interface names,
<tt>Record</tt> and <tt>Key</tt> can be referenced.  (This helps the
Java compiler make the connection between the classes and their interfaces.)
<li>
Both of the two classes have more methods than just the ones listed
in interfaces <tt>Record</tt> and <tt>Key</tt>.  This is acceptable,
and does not interfere with connecting the classes to the interfaces.
</ul>

<p>
Class <tt>Book</tt>, keeps its catalog number as an attribute
and gives it away with its <tt>getKey</tt> method; the class
knows nothing about how its key is coded, but this does not matter.
The second class, <tt>CatalogNumber</tt>, uses a string and a double as
its internal state.  The latter's <tt>equal</tt> method holds particular
interest:

<tt>CatalogNumber</tt>'s <tt>equals</tt> method must
compare its string and its double to the string and double
to the integer held in its
argument, <tt>c</tt>. 
To do
this, <tt>c</tt> must be <em>cast</em> into its
underlying type, <tt>CatalogNumber</tt>, so that the <tt>getNumberCode</tt>
and <tt>getNumberCode</tt> methods
can be queried for <tt>c</tt>'s string and its double:
<pre>
  public boolean equals(Key c)
  { String s = ((CatalogNumber)c).getLetterCode();
    double d = ((CatalogNumber)c).getNumberCode();
    return ( s.equals(letter_code)  &&  d == number_code );
  }
</pre>
The reason for this extra work, is that the Java compiler needs some
help at determining exactly what type of object the ``Key'' <tt>c</tt>
really is.  From the perspective 
of the Java compiler, an object that is a <tt>Key</tt>
does not necessarily possess a <tt>getLetterCode</tt>
or <tt>getNumberCode</tt> method;  the cast
tells the compiler that <tt>c</tt> is actually
a <tt>CatalogNumber</tt>, which does possess the two methods.

<p>
Unfortunately, we cannot avoid the cast
by writing <tt>equals</tt>'s header line as
<pre>
public boolean equals(CatalogNumber c)
</pre>
because the parameter's data type <em>would not match</em> the
description of <tt>equals</tt> in
<tt>interface Key</tt>.  We must live with this Java clumsiness.

<p>
Now, we can build
a database that holds <tt>Book</tt> records:
<pre>
Database db = new Database(1000);  // see Figure 4 in the Case Study
CatalogNumber k = new CatalogNumber("Z", 2.5);
Book b = new Book(k, "Great Expectations", "Charles Dickens", 1860);

boolean success = db.insert(b);  // saves (the address) of object  b  in  db

Record find_me = db.find(k);  // returns the address of the record whose key
              //  is equal to  k.  Of course, this will be the address of  b

System.out.println( ((Book)find_me).getTitle() );  // the cast tells the
               //  Java compiler that it's OK to  getTitle  from the record
</pre>

<p>
Figure 7 shows the card catalogue's class diagram.
<pre>FIGURE 7: class diagram with interfaces==================================

<img src="DatabaseExample/db.gif">

ENDFIGURE==============================================================</pre>
The diagram shows that <tt>Database</tt> is coupled only to the two
interfaces and not to the classes that implement the interfaces.  This
is a clear signal that other classes of records and keys can be
used with <tt>class Database</tt>.

<p>
Another interesting feature of the structure is that <tt>class Book</tt>
is not coupled to <tt>class CatalogNumber</tt>!  This means that other
forms of keys can be used to identify book objects.
 

<h3>Subtypes and Behavior</h3>


The Java compiler uses <tt>interface</tt>
names as data type names, and the compiler enforces
a <em>subtyping relationship</em> when an interface is implemented: 
if <tt>class C implements I</tt>,
then the data type <tt>C</tt> is a <em>subtype</em>
of the datatype <tt>I</tt>.
It is time to study some of
the consequences.

<p>
We take for granted that the numeric primitive types
are related 
by a subtyping relationship:
<tt>int</tt> is a subtype of
<tt>double</tt>, written <tt>int <= double</tt>, because an
integer can be used in any situation where a double is required,
for example: <tt>double d = 4</tt>  is an acceptable initialization.
Similarly, if a method expects an argument that is a double, as in
<pre>
public double inverseOf(double d)
{ return  1.0 / d; }
</pre>
We can send the method an
integer, e.g., <tt>inverseOf(3)</tt>.
Subtyping relationships simplify our programming;
in particular, cumbersome cast expressions are not required.
For example, it is technically correct but ugly to write
<tt>double d = (double)4</tt>, and thanks to subtyping, we may
omit the cast. 

<p>
In addition to primitive data types, there are object or <em>reference</em>
data types, e.g.,  <tt>JFrame</tt> is a reference data type.
There are subtyping relationships between reference types.
For example, if we write the class,
<tt>public class MyFrame extends JFrame</tt>,
then a new subtyping relationship is created: <tt>MyFrame <= JFrame</tt>.
Similarly, when a class implements an interface, e.g.,
<tt>public class Book implements Record</tt>, <em>a subtyping relationship
is created</em>,  <tt>Book<= Record</tt>.

<p>
As with primitive data types,
subtyping relationships between reference types
establish compatibility.
For example, if <tt>MyFrame extends JFrame</tt>,
then a <tt>MyFrame</tt>
object can be used in any context where a <tt>JFrame</tt> object is
expected. An example is
<pre>
public void resetTitle(JFrame f, String s)
{ f.setTitle(s); }
  ...
MyFrame my_view = new MyFrame();
resetTitle(my_view, "Hello");
</pre>
Method <tt>resetTitle</tt> expects an argument that is a <tt>JFrame</tt>,
because it invokes <tt>JFrame</tt>'s <tt>setTitle</tt> method.
But the actual parameter, <tt>my_view</tt> is acceptable because its
data type is a subtype of <tt>JFrame</tt>, implying that <tt>my_view</tt>
also has a <tt>setTitle</tt> method.

<br>
These ideas carry over to subtyping relationships
created from implementing interfaces.
In the example,
<pre>
Database db = new Database(1000); 
CatalogNumber k = new CatalogNumber("Z", 2.5);
Book b = new Book(k, "Great Expectations", "Charles Dickens", 1860);
db.insert(b); 
</pre>
the database method, <tt>insert</tt>, expects arguments of types
<tt>Record</tt> but it operates properly with ones
of type <tt>Book</tt>
because of the subtyping relationships. 

<br>
If we peek inside computer storage, we see that the above statements
constructed these objects:
<pre>
               ----                         ----
Database db ==| a1 |     CatalogNumber k ==| a3 |
          ---- ----                  ------ ----
Book b ==| a4 |   boolean success ==| true |
          ----                       ------

  a1 : Database
 ----------------   ----
 | Record[] base ==| a2 |
 |              --- ----
 | int count ==| 1 |
 |              ---

  a2 : Record[4]
 --------------------
 |    0    1      2     ...
 | --------------------------
 | | a4 | null | null | ...
 |  -------------------------


  a3 : CatalogNumber                  a4 : Book
 -----------------                  -------------------
 |  String letter_code ==| "abc" |  | Key k ==| a3 |
 |  double number_code ==| 2.5 |    | String title ==| "Great Expectations" |
 |                                  |                 ----------------------
                                    | String author ==| "Charles Dickens" |
                                    |                    -----------------
                                    | int date ==| 1860 |
</pre>
The diagram reminds us that every object in storage is labelled
with the name of the class from which the object was constructed.
This is the <em>run-time data type</em> of the object.  The diagram
also illustrates that run-time data types are distinct from the
data types that appear in assignments.  For example,
the object at address <tt>a4</tt> retains its run-time data type,
<tt>Book</tt>, even though it was assigned into an element of an array
declared to hold <tt>Record</tt>s.  (Look at <tt>a2</tt>'s run-time data
type.)  The situation is acceptable because of the subtyping relationship.

<p>
Consider the
following statements, which build on the above:
<pre>
Record find_me = db.find(k);

System.out.println( ((Book)find_me).getTitle() );  
</pre>
The first statement extracts from the data base the record whose key
equals 
<tt>k</tt>, that is, <tt>a4</tt> is assigned to <tt>find_me</tt>.
But we <em>cannot</em> say, immediately thereafter,
<tt>find_me.getTitle()</tt>, because variable <tt>find_me</tt>
was declared to have
data type <tt>Record</tt>, and there is no <tt>getTitle</tt>
method listed in <tt>interface Record</tt>.  The problem is that the data
base method, <tt>find</tt> returns an object whose data type is
<tt>Record</tt>.

<p>
This is frustrating to the programmer, who knows that <tt>db</tt>
is holding <tt>Book</tt> objects, but Java's compiler and interpreter
are not
intelligent enough to deduce this fact.  Therefore, the programmer
must 
write an explicit cast upon <tt>find_me</tt>,
namely, <tt>(Book)find_me</tt>, to tell the Java compiler
that <tt>find_me</tt> holds an address of an object whose
run-time type will be <tt>Book</tt>.
Only then, can the <tt>getTitle</tt> message be sent.

<p>
If the programmer encounters a situation where she is not certain
herself what is extracted from the database, then the <tt>instanceof</tt>
operation can be used to ask the extracted record its data type, e.g.,
<pre>
Record mystery_record = db.find(mystery_key);
if ( mystery_record instanceof Book)
     { System.out.println( ((Book)mystery_record).getTitle() ); }
else { System.out.println("unknown record type"); }
</pre>
Stated precisely, the phrase, <tt>EXPRESSION instanceof TYPE</tt>,
returns <tt>true</tt> exactly when the run-time data type attached to the
object computed by <tt>EXPRESSION</tt> is a <em>subtype</em> of
<tt>TYPE</tt>.

<h4>A complete application</h4>

<tt>http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/DatabaseExample
</tt></a>,
there is a test application,
<tt>package TestTheDatabase</tt>,
that uses <tt>package DB</tt>
to build a different application with a graphical user interface.

<p>
The application builds and saves ``<tt>BasicPerson</tt>''
records about people
(A <tt>BasicPerson</tt> records holds a key,
a name, and some personal information. The key objects are
``<tt>StringKey</tt>''s, which hold a string that acts as a person's unique
ID.)

<p>
To start the application, type
<pre>
java TestTheDatabase.Start
</pre>
You will see a frame with three buttons that you can push: 
<pre>
<img src="DatabaseExample/test1.gif">
</pre>
When
you press <tt>Insert</tt>, you will be asked to invent
a string that will be used to construct a <tt>StringKey</tt> object.
Then, you will be asked to type a person's name and some personal information.
The <tt>StringKey</tt> object, the name, and the information
are inserted into a
newly constructed <tt>BasicPerson</tt> object, which is stored in the database.

<p>
Now, press <tt>Find</tt> and see what happens---you are asked to type
a string that can be used to construct a <tt>StringKey</tt>
object and do a lookup in the
database.

<p>
The example shows how <tt>package DB</tt> is used in a completed application.
The example also shows how a new collection of classes implement
<tt>interface Key</tt> and <tt>interface Record</tt>.
