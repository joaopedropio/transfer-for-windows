<h2>Inductively defined data structures</h2>
   
Roughly stated, there are three species of data structures in the
computing world:
<ul>
<li>
<em>tabular data structures</em>, like arrays and tables and grids.
The objects held within an
tabular data structure
are equally visible and accessible, e.g.,
<pre>
Array-------------------+
| "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" |
+-----------------------+
</pre>
all four objects live at the same ``level.''
A loop is used to systematically process the contents of the structure,
examining Cell 0, Cell 1, Cell 2, etc.
<p>
<li>
<em>linked data structures</em>, like singly and doubly linked lists,
graphs, and networks.
Individual objects are held in small ``containers'' or ``cells'' that
are linked together.   Extra variables are used to remember entry
points into the linked structure, e.g.,
<pre>

front    Cell--+---+    Cell--+---+    Cell--+------+   rear
| o-|--> | "a" | o-|--> | "b" | o-|--> | "c" | null |<--|-o |
+---+    +-----+---+    +-----+---+    +-----+------+   +---+
</pre>
A loop is used to traverse the cells of the list,
starting from the entry point and following the links embedded in
the cells of the list.
<p>
<li>
<em>layered (or recursive) data structures</em>, like lists and trees and
file (folder) systems.
The objects held within
a layered data structure are organized into ``levels''
or ``layers'' such that access to an object must be done by entering
the structure's levels one at a time until the level is reached where the
desired object resides:
<pre>
Cell-----------------------+
|     "a"                  |
|     Cell--------------+  |
|     |    "b"          |  |
|     |    Cell-------+ |  |
|     |    |    "c"   | |  |
|     |    |    null  | |  |
|     |    +----------+ |  |
|     +-----------------+  |
+--------------------------+
</pre>
A recursively defined method is used to
systematically process the contents of the structure.

<p>
When a recursive data structure is designed so that each of its
levels contains levels of only simpler complexity, then we say
that the structure is an <em>inductive data structure</em>.
(An example of a layered data structure that is not inductive is a list
of infinite length.)  In this course, we work only with
inductive data structures.
</ul>
The above three classifications are <em>conceptual</em>; how we
code these ideas into Java or Prolog or C is our decision.
(For example, we might implement a layered data structure using
links!)

<p>
Although it may seem initially awkward to organize objects into levels,
the technique is valuable in practice, because it readily
supports structures that can organically ``grow'' while a program
executes.


<h3>How to define an inductive data structure</h3>

<p>
We used <tt>class Cell</tt> to <em>implement</em> a data type
of lists.  It is time to define precisely what a list <em>is</em>.
The classic name is a <em>cons list</em> (or conslist),
and we describe it precisely by means of a set of definitional clauses:

<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>Conslist</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>Nil</tt>; or
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>Cons(h, t)</tt>, where <tt>h</tt> is an
<tt>Object</tt> and <tt>t</tt> is
another <tt>Conslist</tt>-object.
</ul>
</dl>
(The terms, <tt>Cons</tt> and <tt>Nil</tt> --- rather than
<tt>Cell</tt> and <tt>null</tt> --- are the traditional ones.)
This form of definition is called an <em>inductive definition</em>,
because we can use it to describe and generate finite-level
Conslist objects. 

<p>
If you wish, you can ``draw'' the inductive definition
<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>Conslist</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is a structure,
<pre>
Nil
</pre>
<li>
or,
it is a <tt>Cons</tt>- structure,
<pre>
Cons-----------------+
|  h: Object         |
|  t: +-Conslist-+   |
|     |  ...     |   |
|     +----------+   |
+--------------------+
</pre>
</ul>
</dl>

For example,
<pre>
Cons-----------------------+
|  h: "a"                  |
|  t: Cons--------------+  |
|     | h: "b"          |  |
|     | t: Cons-------+ |  |
|     |    | h: "c"   | |  |
|     |    | t: Nil   | |  |
|     |    +----------+ |  |
|     +-----------------+  |
+--------------------------+
</pre>
is a picture of a Conslist that holds three string objects,
<tt>"a"</tt>, <tt>"b"</tt>, and <tt>"c"</tt>, within three levels
of nested structure. 

<p>
Since the pictures quickly get huge, we will often use
the linear forms, e.g.,
<pre>
Cons("a", Cons("b", Cons("c", Nil) ) )
</pre>
to indicate the list's nested structure.

<p>
The correctness of the structure's construction is
is formally justified as follows:
<ol>
<li>
By Clause 2, <tt>Nil</tt> is a Conslist object;
<li>
Since <tt>Nil</tt> is a conslist object and <tt>"c"</tt> is a (string)
object, then by Clause 1, 
<tt>Cons("c", Nil)</tt> is a conslist object;
<li>
Since <tt>Cons("c", Nil)</tt> is a Conslist object and
<tt>"b"</tt> is an object, then by Clause 1,
<tt>Cons("b", Cons("c", Nil))</tt> is a Conslist object;
<li>
By similar justification,
<tt>Cons("a", Cons("b", Cons("c", Nil)))</tt> is a Conslist object.
</ol>

<p>
Now, data-structure building is a kind of physical ``game'', where we
start with some basic piece, e.g., <tt>Nil</tt>, and we place it along
with an object, like <tt>"c"</tt>, in a box --- a <tt>Cons</tt> box.
We then place the <tt>Cons</tt> box plus another object, say
<tt>"b"</tt>, into another <tt>Cons</tt> box.  And so on.
This is how we build Conslists.

<p>
Later, when we want to retrieve the string objects we ``packed''
into the Conslist, we will have to ``open'' the
<tt>Cons</tt> boxes, one level at a time. 

<!--
<p>
We informally use a linear notation, e.g.,
<tt>Cons("a", Cons("b", Cons("c", Nil)))</tt> to represent the
layered structure of a Conslist.  We will freely move between the graphical
and linear notation.
-->


<h3>How we have implemented Conslists in Java</h3>

<p>
Given the inductive definition of conslist, we must use Java
programming phrases to mimick the definition.  Here is the way we
were doing it, without even knowing that we were doing it:
<ul>
<li>the <tt>Nil</tt> object is coded as <tt>null</tt>
<li>the <tt>Cons(h, t)</tt> object is coded as
<tt>new Cell(h, t)</tt>, using <tt>class Cell</tt>.
</ul>
Hence, the conslist drawn above is written this tersely in Java:
<pre>
new Cell("a", new Cell("b", new Cell("c", null)))
</pre>
Of course, we can assemble this 3-level structure in increments, if we
desire:
<pre>
Cell x = new Cell("c", null);
Cell y = new Cell("b", x);
Cell z = new Cell("a", y);
</pre>

<!--
<p>
In some ways, it is a bit barbaric to use <tt>null</tt>, the
``no value'' noun in Java, to denote a 0-level structural value.
While we are at it, we might wish to change from <tt>class Cell</tt> to
<tt>class Cons</tt>.  We will do exactly this a bit later; for now,
we will use what we already know.
-->


<h3>How to program operations on conslists</h3>

<p>
When a data type is defined with an inductive definition, 
<em>computation on elements of the data type is also defined
inductively (recursively)</em>,
and this is implemented by means of a recursively
defined method. 

<p>
The idea goes as follows:  Since there are two forms of Conslists,
then we should have two recipes for processing a Conslist---one for
the <tt>Nil</tt>-structure and one for the <tt>Cons</tt>-structure.
We might write each ``recipe'' as an equation, from algebra, like this:
<pre>
process( Nil ) =  return ...some simple answer...

process( Cons(h, t) ) =  ... use recursion to compute  t_answer = process(t);
                         return ...an answer built from  h  and  t_answer...
</pre>
Here is the <tt>lengthOf</tt> example specified in equational style:
<pre>
/** length of  a ConsList:  */
lengthOf( Nil ) = 0
lengthOf( Cons(h, t) ) =  1 + lengthOf(t)
</pre>
This set of equations, <em>one per clause in the inductive definition</em>,
describes the computational steps needed to descend into the levels
of a conslist object so that we can compute its length (or, if you will,
its <em>depth</em>).

<p>
The above schema is mechanically reformatted into
a Java method when we use <tt>null</tt> and
<tt>class Cell</tt> to implement a conslist:
<pre>
public int lengthOf(Cell l)
{ int length;
  if ( l == null )
       { length = 0; }
  else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
  return length;
}
</pre>
Indeed, for inductively defined data structures, the equational-schema
format gives us a fool-proof algorithm for processing the data structures!

<h3>How the recursions execute on the Conslists</h3>

Let's do some algebra with the equational formulation of <tt>lengthOf</tt> to
count the length (depth) of the conslist,
<tt>Cons("a", Cons("b", Cons("c", Nil)))</tt>.  Here is the definition,
again:
<pre>
lengthOf(Nil) = 0
lengthOf( Cons(h, t) ) =  1 + lengthOf(t)
</pre>
and here is the calculation, like one would do in algebra class:
<pre>
lengthOf( Cons("a", Cons("b", Cons("c", Nil))) )

       because the argument has form,  Cons(...,...),
         use the second equation:

= 1 + lengthOf( Cons("b", Cons("c", Nil)) )

       again, use the second equation:

= 1 + 1 + lengthOf( Cons("c", Nil) )

= 1 + 1 + 1 + lengthOf( Nil )

       the first equation applies here:

= 1 + 1 + 1 + 0

= 3
</pre>
Here is a two-dimensional drawing of the above calculation;
the drawing shows how the recursive style of data-structure processing
descends into the Conslist structure while it calculates its answer:
<pre>
lengthOf(
Cons-----------------------+
|     "a"                  |
|     Cons--------------+  |
|     |    "b"          |  |
|     |    Cons-------+ |  |
|     |    |    "c"   | |  |
|     |    |    Nil   | |  |
|     |    +----------+ |  |
|     +-----------------+  |
+--------------------------+  )

=  1 +
      lengthOf(
      Cons--------------+   
      |    "b"          |   
      |    Cons-------+ |   
      |    |    "c"   | |   
      |    |    Nil   | |   
      |    +----------+ |   
      +-----------------+   )

= 1 +
    1 +
       lengthOf(
           Cons-------+     
           |    "c"   |     
           |    Nil   |     
           +----------+ )

= 1 +
    1 +
      1 +
        lengthOf( Nil )

= 1 + 1 + 1 + 0  =  3
</pre>

<p>
How does the above reasoning translate into Java programming?
Once again, here is the coding of <tt>lengthOf</tt> in Java:
<pre>
public int lengthOf(Cell l)
{ int length;
  if ( l == null )
       { length = 0; }
  else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
  return length;
}
</pre>
We might well ask: Does the execution of the Java coding
construct the graphical structures shown in the above drawings?
Well, not exactly---recall that computer heap storage is ``flat''
and nonnested.   Remember that we have been using <tt>Cell</tt>s to
represent such conslists.
Hence, a three-level nested structure like
<tt>Cons("a", Cons("b", Cons("c", Nil)))</tt> is in fact mimicked
by three separate cells (and <tt>null</tt>) that
are linked together with storage addresses:
<pre>
a4 : Cell----+       a3: Cell----+       a2: Cell---+  
|  "a"       |       |   "b"     |       |  "c"     | 
|  a3        |       |   a2      |       |  null    |
+------------+       +-----------+       +----------+
</pre>
Remember also that a series
of recursive-method invocations are modelled
with the activation-record stack in the Java Virtual machine.
Thus, an execution configuration like this one:
<pre>
1 + 1 + lengthOf( Cons("c", Nil) )
</pre>
or drawn graphically,
<pre>
  1 +
    1 +
       lengthOf(
           Cons-------+
           |    "c"   |
           |    Nil   |
           +----------+ )
</pre>
shows the situation where a list is partially counted due to
3 recursions.   Recall from the previous lecture that,
within the Java Virtual Machine, the
activation-record stack looks like this:
(Note: the stack is tipped on its
side so that it is growing from left to right.)
<pre>
                                                  top
                                                   |
+--------------------------------------------------V-----
| +---------------+ +---------------+ +-----------+
| | l == a4       | | l == a3       | | l == a2   |
| | length = 1 + ?| | length = 1 + ?| |           |
| |  ...          | |  ...          | |   ...     |
| +---------------+ +---------------+ +-----------+
+--------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
The activation-record stack shows that <tt>lengthOf</tt> has started
three times, and the most recent activation is trying to count the
length of the list at address <tt>a2</tt>.  Once the <tt>a2</tt>-list
length is counted, then the answer, an integer, will be returned
to the caller, which adds one to it, giving the length of the
<tt>a3</tt> list.  <em>That</em> answer is returned, to its caller,
which adds one, giving the length of the <tt>a4</tt>-list.

<p>
Again, please review the previous lecture to see how the Java Virtual
Machine uses an activation-record stack to compute recursive method
calls.

<p>
In summary, the equational calculations and two-dimensional drawings
give us powerful design and reasoning tools that are more elegant
than but nonetheless consistent with
the actual computer implementation.  When trying to solve a complex
data-structure problem, it is often helpful to visualize the solution as
a graphical computation on the nested, recursive data structure.



<h3>More examples of Conslist calculations</h3>

<p>
If you are interested,
here is another standard example written in the recursive style:
<pre>
/** toString assembles a string representation of a Conslist:  */
toString(Nil) = ""
toString( Cons(h, t) ) =  h.toString() + " " + toString(t)
</pre>
It is easy to reformat this example into a recursive Java method:
<pre>
public String toString(Cell l)
{ String answer;
  if ( l == null )
       { answer = ""; }
  else { answer = l.getVal().toString() + " " + toString(l.getNext()); 
       }
  return answer;
}
</pre>

<p>
Both <tt>lengthOf</tt> and <tt>toString</tt> are simple examples
of recursive processing that traverses all elements of
a conslist.  Of course, we know that we can traverse a list with
a mere while-loop.  Are there patterns of list processing that are
not merely mimicking loops?   Yes---here are two:
<pre>
/** append accepts two conslists as arguments and 
  *  build sa new list that has the contents 
  *  of the two, appended together */
append(Nil, ys) = ys
append(Cons(h, t),  ys) =  Cons(h, append(t, ys))
</pre>
The above pattern is worth pondering---<tt>append(list1, list2)</tt>
says we should build the appended list by descending into the
innermost structure of <tt>list1</tt>, level by level, attaching
<tt>list1</tt>'s elements onto the front of <tt>list2</tt> as we go.
It is enlightening to see this in a calculational trace:
<pre>
append( Cons("a", Cons("b", Nil)),  Cons("z", Nil) )
= Cons("a",  append( Cons("b", Nil),  Cons("z", Nil) ))
= Cons("a",  Cons("b",  append( Nil, Cons("z", Nil) )))
= Cons("a",  Cons("b",  Cons("z", Nil)))
</pre>
Notice how the <tt>Cons</tt> structures are <em>enclosing</em> the 
recursive invocations.

<p>
It is fun to redraw the calculation graphically:
<pre>
append(
Cons--------------+      Cons-------+
|    "a"          |      |    "z"   |
|    Cons-------+ |      |    Nil   |
|    |    "b"   | |      +----------+  )
|    |    Nil   | |   
|    +----------+ |   
+-----------------+  ,

=

Cons--------------------------------------------+
|    "a"                                        |
|    append( Cons-------+     Cons-------+      |
|            |    "b"   |     |    "z"   |      |
|            |    Nil   |     |    Nil   |      |
|            +----------+ ,   +----------+  )   |
+-----------------------------------------------+

=

Cons--------------------------------------------+
|    "a"                                        |
|    Cons---------------------------------+     |
|    |    "b"                             |     |
|    |    append( Nil,  Cons-------+      |     |
|    |                  |    "z"   |      |     |
|    |                  |    Nil   |      |     |
|    |                  +----------+  )   |     |
|    +------------------------------------+     |
+-----------------------------------------------+

=

Cons---------------------------+
|    "a"                       |
|    Cons----------------+     |
|    |    "b"            |     |
|    |    Cons-------+   |     |
|    |    |    "z"   |   |     |
|    |    |    Nil   |   |     |
|    |    +----------+   |     |
|    +-------------------+     |
+------------------------------+
</pre>
It is a bit amazing that we can replicate this systematic recursive
descent in Java, but we can:
<pre>
public Cell append(Cell list1, Cell list2)
{ Cell answer;
  if ( list1 == null )
       { answer = list2; }
  else { answer =
            new Cell(list1.getVal(),
                     append(list1.getNext(), list2));
       }
  return answer;
}
</pre>
The power comes from nesting the recursive invocation,
<tt>append(list1.getNext(), list2)</tt>
<em>inside</em> the use of <tt>new Cell( ... )</tt>!

<p>
Here is a question for you to consider:  For this example,
<pre>
Cell alist = new Cell("a", new Cell("b", null));
Cell blist = new Cell("z", null));
Cell clist = append(alist, blist);
</pre>
are either of <tt>alist</tt> or <tt>blist</tt> altered due to
the use of <tt> append(alist, blist)</tt> to construct <tt>clist</tt>?
The answer is <em>no</em>---indeed, <tt>clist</tt> and <tt>blist</tt>
share the same objects, but the lists are not altered!
(If you are uncertain of this, draw a picture of computer heap storage
and work the example by hand.)

<p>
Here is a second example that employs a similar cleverness:
<pre>
/** reverse builds a list that is the reversed version
  *  of its argument */
reverse(Nil) = Nil
reverse(Cons(h, t)) = append( reverse(t), Cons(h, Nil) )
</pre>
This one is a fun exercise for you to work for yourself:
<pre>
public Cell reverse(Cell list)
{ Cell answer;
  if ( list1 == null )
       { answer = null; }
  else { answer = append(reverse(list.getNext()),
                         new Cell(list.getVal(), null));
       }
  return answer;
}
</pre>
A question: why must we use <tt>new Cell(list.getVal(), null)</tt>
and not just <tt>list.getVal()</tt>?


<h3>Other inductively defined data structures</h3>

<p>
Other data structures can be defined by means of inductive definition.
Here are some classic examples:

<h4>File Systems</h4>

The standard disk file system is perhaps the best known inductively
defined data structure:
<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>FileSystem</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>Textfile</tt>; or
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>Folder(t1, ..., tm, f1, ..., fn)</tt>,
where m >= 0 and n>= 0, 
all <tt>ti</tt> are  <tt>Textfile</tt>s, and
all <tt>fj</tt> are <tt>Filesystem</tt>s.
</ul>
</dl>
The second clause of the definition states that folders can hold
zero or more textfiles and zero or more (sub)folders.

<p>
A huge advantage of this form of file system is that it can grow
as deeply as needed when the user adds more and more textfiles and folders.

<p>
Say that we want to write a program that counts all the textfiles held
in a file system.  How do we start?   The equational specifications
show us the way:
<pre>
/** countFiles  counts the number of textfiles in a file system */

countFiles( Textfile ) =  return 1;

countFiles( Folder(t1, ..., tm, f1, ..., fn) )
   =  subcounts = 0;
      for ( j in 1 to n )  subcounts = subcounts + countFiles(fj);
      return  m + subcounts;
</pre>
The recursions into the subfolders neatly total the counts of textfiles
in the subfolders, which we sum into the total count.


<h4>Natural numbers</h4>

The <em>natural numbers</em> are the nonnegative integers---0, 1, 2,
etc.  Surprisingly, these numbers can be viewed as structures in an
inductively defined data type:
<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>Nat</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is the object, <tt>Zero</tt>; or
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>Succ( N )</tt>, where <tt>N</tt> is an existing
<tt>Nat</tt> object.
</ul>
</dl>
With this formulation,
<tt>0</tt> is represented as <tt>Zero</tt>,
<tt>1</tt> is represented as <tt>Succ(Zero)</tt>,
<tt>2</tt> is represented as <tt>Succ(Succ(Zero))</tt>,
and so on.  (Think of <tt>Nat</tt> objects as the numbers in
``base one'' arithmetic.)

<p>
Admittedly, representing numbers as nested structures is a game, 
but the ``game'' motivates modern-day set theory and even the
construction of computer circuits.

<p>
Here are some examples of processing natural numbers:

<p>
Checking if a number is even:
<pre>
isEven(Zero) = true
isEven(Succ(N)) = !isEven(N)
</pre>
An example: is <tt>3</tt> even?
<pre>
isEven(Succ(Succ(Succ(Zero))))
= ! isEven(Succ(Succ(Zero)))
= ! ! isEven(Succ(Zero))
= ! ! ! isEven(Zero)
= ! ! ! true
= ! ! false
= ! true
= false
</pre>

<p>
Doubling a number:
<pre>
double( Zero ) = Zero
double( Succ(N) ) = Succ(Succ( timesTwo(N) ))
</pre>
Try it---say we compute <tt>double( Succ(Succ(Zero)) )</tt>:
<pre>
double( Succ(Succ(Zero)) )
= Succ(Succ( double( Succ(Zero) ) ))
= Succ(Succ( Succ(Succ( double(Zero) )) ))
= Succ(Succ( Succ(Succ( Zero )) ))
</pre>

<p>
Addition:
<pre>
add( Zero,  N ) = N,   where  N  is any Nat-object whatsoever
add( Succ(M), N ) =  Succ( add(M,N) )
</pre>
An example of <tt>3 + 2</tt>:
<pre>
add( Succ(Succ(Succ(Zero))),  Succ(Succ(Zero)) )
= Succ(  add(Succ(Succ(Zero)), Succ(Succ(Zero)) )
= Succ( Succ( add(Succ(Zero)), Succ(Succ(Zero)) ))
= Succ( Succ( Succ( add(Zero, Succ(Succ(Zero)) )))
= Succ( Succ( Succ( Succ(Succ(Zero)) )))
</pre>

<p>
Multiplication:
<pre>
mult( Zero,  N ) = Zero
mult( Succ(M), N) = add(N, mult(M, N))
</pre>
This definition exploits the arithmetical fact that multiplication is
repeated addition.
Here is <tt>3 * 2</tt>:
<pre>
mult( Succ(Succ(Succ(Zero))),  Succ(Succ(Zero)) )
= add( Succ(Succ(Zero)),  mult( Succ(Succ(Zero)), Succ(Succ(Zero)) ) )
= add( Succ(Succ(Zero)),  add( Succ(Succ(Zero)),  mult( Succ(Zero), Succ(Succ(Zero)) ) )))
= add( Succ(Succ(Zero)),  add( Succ(Succ(Zero)),  
        add( Succ(Succ(Zero)), mult(Zero, Succ(Succ(Zero)) ))))
= add( Succ(Succ(Zero)),  add( Succ(Succ(Zero)),  
        add( Succ(Succ(Zero)), Zero))))
</pre>
At this point, we can apply the definition of <tt>add</tt>
to compute the final answer,
<tt>Succ(Succ(Succ(Succ(Succ(Succ(Zero)))))</tt>.

<p>
In a similar way, all of arithmetic can be defined as recursively
defined operations on <tt>Nat</tt> objects, and indeed,
all mechanical computation can be formalized <em>solely</em> in terms
of recursive programming patterns on <tt>Nat</tt> objects.

<h4>Binary numerals</h4>

Electronic
computers perform arithmetic on binary numbers , which can be exposed
as an inductively defined data type:
<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>BinaryNumeral</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is the object, <tt>0</tt>; or
<li>
it is the object, <tt>1</tt>; or
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>[N]0</tt>, where <tt>N</tt> is an existing
<tt>BinaryNumeral</tt> object.  (Usually, we write this as just <tt>N0</tt>.)
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>[N]1</tt>, where <tt>N</tt> is an existing
<tt>BinaryNumeral</tt> object.  (Usually, we write this as just <tt>N1</tt>.)
</ul>
</dl>
For example, the binary numeral 13, normally written as 1101,
has this internal structure:  <tt>[[[1]1]0]1</tt>
The internal structure is important, because it is exploited in the
wiring of arithmetic operations into a computer chip.

<p>
An example:
<pre>
/** computing the decimal value of a BinaryNumber:  */
valueOf(0) = 0
valueOf(1) = 1
valueOf([N]0) = 2 * valueOf(N)
valueOf([N]1) = (2 * valueOf(N)) + 1
</pre>

As an exercise, you might write the equations for adding, multiplying,
etc., binary numbers.  The equations you write turn out to be one
form of the wiring diagrams taught in circuit theory.

<h4>Booleans</h4>

An inductive data type need not have recursion in its definition:
<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>boolean</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is the object, <tt>false</tt>; or
<li>
it is the object, <tt>true</tt>
</ul>
</dl>
Although there is no recursion in the inductive definition, the same
principles apply when designing operations on elements of the type:
<pre>
negation(false) = true
negation(true) = false

and(false, B) = false   (for any boolean, B)
and(true, B) = B        (for any boolean, B)

or(false, B) = B        (for any boolean, B)
or(true, B) = true      (for any boolean, B)
</pre>

<h4>Binary Trees</h4>
Soon, we will study this data type in great detail, as it is perhaps
the most important one in data structures:
<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>BinaryTree</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is the object, <tt>Leaf</tt>; or
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>Node(v, l, r)</tt>, where <tt>v</tt> is an
<tt>Object</tt>, and <tt>l</tt> and <tt>r</tt> are already existing
<tt>BinaryTree</tt>-objects.
</ul>
</dl>
