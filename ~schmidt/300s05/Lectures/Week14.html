<h1>Graphs</h1>

A road map is an example of a <em>graph</em>.
So is a circuit diagram, a hardware diagram, a flowchart,
a UML class diagram, a work-flow chart, and a structure diagram of a
database system.   Graphs are common, and it is important to know how
to model them and process them within a computer.

<h4>Definition of a graph</h4>

<p>
Precisely stated, a <em>(directed) graph</em> is
<ol>
<li>
a set, <em>N</em>, of <em>nodes</em>
<li>
a set, <em>E</em>, of pairs of elements from <em>N</em>, called <em>edges</em>.
</ol>
For example, this picture of part of the flight plan of American Airlines,
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/graph0.gif">
</pre>
can be written precisely as the graph,
<pre>
N = { KC, Chi, Dal, NYC }
E = { (Dal,KC), (KC,Chi), (Chi,KC), (Chi,Dal), (Dal,Chi), (Chi,NYC)}
</pre>
Each edge has a <em>source</em> and a <em>target</em>
(In the example,
there is an edge whose source is Chi and whose destination is NYC,
but there is no edge whose source is NYC.  It is legal to have
an edge whose source and destination are the same node.)

<p>
A <em>path</em> from a node A to node B is a sequence of zero or more
edges that start at A, connect together, and end at B.  In the example, there is a path
from Dal to NYC but there is no path from NYC to Dal.

<p>
Notice that a tree is a special form of graph, where one node is
called the <em>root</em>, and there is exactly one path from the
root to all the other nodes. Unlike a tree, a graph can have multiple
paths between nodes, and a graph can have
<em>cycles</em> (loops), where a path can go from a starting
node to other nodes and back to the starting node again.


<p>
Another form of graph is an <em>undirected graph</em>, where
every edge from a node A to node B is read also as an edge from
B to A.  We draw an undirected graph without arrowheads on the
edges, like this:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/graph1.gif">
</pre>

<p>
A graph is a <em>weighted graph</em> if some form of label or value
(called a ``weight'')
is attached to each of its edges.  For example, mileages might be attached
to the directed graph seen first,
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/graph0w.gif">
</pre>
The formal representation displays each edge as a triple:
<pre>
N = { KC, Chi, Dal, NYC }
E = { (Dal,600,KC), (KC,500,Chi), (Chi,500,KC), (Chi,800,Dal), (Dal,800,Chi), (Chi,900,NYC)}
</pre>

<h4>Representing graphs in a computer</h4>

<p>
There are two standard ways of storing graphs in a computer:
the <em>adjacency matrix</em> and the <em>adjacency list</em>.

<p>
An adjacency matrix is a kind of ``mileage table'':
<pre>
        Chi  Dal  KC  NYC
       +-----------------
Chi    |  0  800  500 900
       |
Dal    |800    0  600  -1
       |
KC     |500   -1    0  -1
       |
NYC    | -1   -1   -1   0
</pre>
Here, the weights indicate the existence of an edge, and -1 (and 0!)
means there
is no edge.

<p>
The adjacency list organizes the graph's edges into sets, based on the
edges' sources.  Here is the adjacency list for the example:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/adj.gif">
</pre>

<p>
As a rule, use an adjacency matrix to store a graph where there are
edges between almost all the nodes; use an adjacency list when
the graph has few edges, that is, it is <em>sparse</em>,
that is, there are fewer than <em>N * log<sub>2</sub> N</em> edges, for
a graph with <em>N</em> nodes.

<p>
The adjacency matrix and adjacency list are ``raw'' forms of graph
and are not oriented towards solving any particular problem.
The forms of problems that one must solve are typically:
<ul>
<li>
process/print the nodes, e.g., 
check if the graph is <em>connected</em> --- for every node, one can go
to all other nodes
<li>
process/print the edges, e.g.,
find the shortest, weighted path
from one node to another
</ul>

The best way to solve such problems is to extract information from
the adjacency matrix/list and construct an appropriate tree.
There are two important trees built from graphs:
<em>spanning trees</em> and <em>regular trees</em>.

<h4>Spanning trees</h4>

<p>
A spanning tree is a tree that lists all the nodes in a graph but
not necessarily all the edges.  Its root is the ``entry node''
into the graph.
Here are spanning trees that we can generate from the
example directed graph where we use Dal as the entry node.  For simplicity,
we omit the weights on the edges, since spanning trees are normally
used to answer questions about the nodes.  
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/spanDal.gif">
</pre>
and here is a spanning tree for entry node, NYC:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/spanNYC.gif">
</pre>
Spanning trees are good for answering questions/do processing of
the nodes in a graph, where the edges are unimportant to the answer.
For example, we can use a spanning tree to answer:
Is there a path from one node to another?
Is one node connected to all others?

<h4>Regular trees</h4>

<p>
A regular tree is a tree that generates all the paths that can be taken
starting from an entry node, where along every path, no node repeats.
Here is the regular tree that generates all paths from entry node, KC:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/reg.gif">
</pre>
The point is, when we reach a node that repeats in a path, it is the
same as a backwards arc --- a loop:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/reg2.gif">
</pre>
Here is the regular tree that generates all paths from entry node,
Chi:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/reg3.gif">
</pre>
Regular trees are built to answer questions/do processing of the
paths in a graph, where the edges and weights are important to the answer.
For example, we can use a regular tree to answer: list all the paths
from one node to another; find the shortest (weighted) path from one
node to another.

<p>
We now examine two standard and classic graph problems and
show how to use the trees to solve them.

<h3>Application: modelling sets by spanning trees --- UNION-FIND</h3>

For simplicity, we work with undirected graphs in this section.

<p>
A collection of graph nodes is <em>connected</em> if for every node in
the collection, there
is a path to every other node in the collection.  For this (undirected) graph:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/spanW.gif">
</pre>
There are two connected collections: <tt>{Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul}</tt>
and <tt>{KC, Dal, Chi, NYC}</tt>.

<p>
The collections are disjoint ``sets,'' and such sets play a crucial role
in answering questions of the form: ``Is there a path from node A to node B?''
or ``Do A and B belong to the same set?''
To answer the question, we check if A and B are in the same
connected collection.

<p>
To answer
such questions, it is useful to maintain
spanning trees that include all the nodes of the graph.  For the example,
two spanning trees are required, one for each ``set'':
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/spanW1.gif">
</pre>
Now, to answer the question, ``can we go from A to B?'', we check
if nodes A and B have the same root in the spanning tree(s) where
they are saved.  For example, we can check
``Can we go from Dal to NYC?'' by finding Dal and NYC and confirming
that they share the same root, KC.

<p>
Another view is that each set is named by the root of its spanning
tree --- in the example, we have the Tokyo set and the KC set.
Then, the questions just asked are set-membership questions:
``Is Dal in the KC-set''?

<p>
The previous checks of ``connectivity'' take time <em>O(log<sub>2</sub>N)</em>,
where <em>N</em> is the number of nodes in the graph (assuming that
we can locate the source and destination nodes in fixed time,
which we can do if we save the addresses of all the spanning-tree
nodes in a hash table or spelling tree).

<p>
The operation is called a FIND operation.  There is also
a UNION operation, which corresponds to unioning together
two sets:

<p>
Say that flights are added between Chi and Osaka, that is,
an edge has been added between these two nodes.  How can we efficiently
combine the spanning trees to reflect the new graph edge?

<p>
There is a simple solution to updating the spanning trees:
draw a line between Chi's root and Osaka's:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/spanW2.gif">
</pre>
This does a ``union'' of the two ``sets'' and is called a UNION operation.

<p>
One drawback of the simple definition of UNION is that it can create
unbalanced spanning trees --- the above tree is not height-balanced.  
One way to improve UNION is to link the spanning tree with fewer nodes
to the one with more nodes.  For the above example, this would
cause Tokyo's tree to link to KC's, which gives a slightly better
balance.

<p>
But we can do better:
the FIND operation is often
improved so that it rebalances a spanning tree after
it finds a path from a node in the spanning tree to its root ---
each time a FIND operation is performed, all the nodes traversed 
on the path to the root are attached directly to the root.
For the above example, a FIND operation on NYC would cause both
NYC and Chi to be relinked directly to the root, Tokyo:
<pre>
         Tokyo
  /     /   |   \    \
Seoul Osaka KC  Chi  NYC
            |
            Dal
</pre>

<h3>Application: finding the shortest path --- Dijkstra's algorithm</h3>

Consider again this directed, weighted graph:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/graph0w.gif">
</pre>
A classic question that we might ask is: What is the shortest path
(in terms of the weights) from one node to another?
For example, what is the shortest path from Dal to NYC?

<p>
A naive solution would enumerate all possible paths from Dal to NYC,
say by using a stack and depth-first search, starting from
``root node'' Dal.  But there is a smarter, faster solution,
due to Dijkstra, which constructs a regular tree that enumerates only
the ``short'' paths.

<p>
The key idea behind Dijkstra's algorithm is:
generate a regular tree whose root is the start node; generate all
possible paths from the root, but stop a path if either
<ol>
<li>
the next node in the path is one that has already appeared in the
path (this signifies the path has entered a loop and is not the shortest
solution;
it is the usual criterion for stopping a path
in a regular tree)
<li>
the next node is the destination node (and so we calculate the weight
of the path from the root to the destination and see if it is the
least we have seen so far)
<li>
the next node is a node that we have already reached 
<em>in some other path in the tree</em> and the weight of the other
path is already less-than-or-equal-to the weight of the path
we are just now constructing --- this means the path we are just now
constructing cannot be the shortest path
</ol>
To help calculate the weights of the paths, we will annotate
each node of the regular tree with the weight of the path from the
root to that node.  To remember each shortest path
so far from the root to any given node, we will keep an array to
remember the weights.

<p>
Here is an example --- say we want the shortest path
from Dal to NYC in the graph just seen.  We begin with this
this array and initial regular tree:
<pre>
           Dal  Chi   KC  NYC
          +----+----+----+----+
shortest: |   0|   ?|   ?|   ?|
          +----+----+----+----+
</pre>
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/sh0.gif">
</pre>

<p>
The array notes that the shortest path from Dal to Dal is 0;
the other distances are undetermined at this time.

<p>
The edges from Dal generate this slightly larger regular tree
and update the array to read
<pre>
           Dal  Chi   KC  NYC
          +----+----+----+----+
shortest: |   0| 800| 600|   ?|
          +----+----+----+----+
</pre>
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/sh1.gif">
</pre>
Now, we must develop the tree at the nodes KC and Chi.
When we try to develop KC, we find an edge that leads to Chi:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/sh2.gif">
</pre>
But when we calculate the weight of the path from Dal to KC to Chi,
we find that it is already larger than the weight already stored in
the array as the shortest known weight from Dal to Chi.  This means
there is no need to develop this path further, and we stop:
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/sh3.gif">
</pre>

<p>
When we develop Chi, we find three edges: the first, to KC is to a node
that has been seen before.   The array tells us that the path found earlier to
KC had weight 600, so the current path,
which has weight 800+500 = 1300, is not least and can be terminated.
The next edge leads to
to Dal and
a repeat of a node already seen on this path, so there is no way that
this path can be shortest; we terminate this path.  The third
edge goes from Chi to NYC, and we update the array with our discovery:
<pre>
           Dal  Chi   KC  NYC
          +----+----+----+----+
shortest: |   0| 800| 600|1700|
          +----+----+----+----+
</pre>
<pre>
<img src="GraphFigs/sh4.gif">
</pre>
The path from Dal to NYC is complete, and we stop this path.

<p>
At this point, all paths in the regular tree are completely developed,
and we quit --- the shortest path goes from Dal to Chi to NYC.


<p>
Finally, we note that, in the previous example, the regular tree itself
need not be explicitly constructed in computer storage.  Instead,
we keep a second array that remembers the edges that yielded the shortest path.
Here is the example repeated, with the two arrays, one that remembers the
weights and one that remembers the individual edges in the
shortest path that we build:
<pre>
           Dal  Chi   KC  NYC
          +----+----+----+----+
shortest: |   0|   ?|   ?|   ?|
          +----+----+----+----+

	  Dal  Chi   KC  NYC
	 +----+----+----+----+
previous:|null|   ?|   ?|   ?|
	 +----+----+----+----+
</pre>
After the moves from Dal:
<pre>
           Dal  Chi   KC  NYC
	  +----+----+----+----+
shortest: |   0| 800| 600|   ?|
          +----+----+----+----+

	   Dal  Chi   KC  NYC
          +----+----+----+----+
previous: |null| Dal| Dal|   ?|
          +----+----+----+----+
</pre>
For city <tt>C</tt>,  <tt>previous[C]</tt> remembers the immediate
predecessor node
whose edge delivers us to city <tt>C</tt> on the shortest path.
For example,  <tt>previous[KC]</tt> tells us that the shortest
known path from Dal to KC ends with an edge from Dal to KC, and
<tt>shortest[KC]</tt> tells us that the weight of the shortest
path from Dal to KC is 600.

<p>
After the attempted moves from KC, there are no change to the arrays.
The move from Chi to NYC gives the answer and the last edge in the
shortest path:
<pre>
           Dal  Chi   KC  NYC
	  +----+----+----+----+
shortest: |   0| 800| 600|1700|
          +----+----+----+----+

	   Dal  Chi   KC  NYC
          +----+----+----+----+
previous: |null| Dal| Dal| Chi|
          +----+----+----+----+
</pre>
Now, we see that the shortest path from Dal to NYC must end with the
edge from  <tt>previous[NYC]</tt> to NYC, that is, from Chi to NYC.
And, we see that the shortest path from Dal to Chi must end with the
edge, <tt>previous[Chi]</tt> to Chi.

<p>
Indeed, we can assemble the path from the edges,
listed in reverse:  NYC-Chi-Dal (null).
