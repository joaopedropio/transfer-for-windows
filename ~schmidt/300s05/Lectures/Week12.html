<h2>Priority Queues and Heaps</h2>


<h4>Priority queues</h4>

At the post office, express mail is processed and delivered before
regular mail, because express mail's priority is higher.  In a
similar way, an operating system will let a high-priority user
control a printer or a processor chip before a low-priority user.
A data structure, called a <em>priority queue</em>, is used to
manage such resource usage.

<p>
A priority queue is a data structure that is meant to hold objects
that require ``service'' (e.g., use of a printer).  The essential
operations are:
<ul>
<li>
<em>insert(priority_num, ob)</em>, which adds <em>ob</em> to the
structure, paired with an integer priority number.  (The tradition
is that the lower the priority number, the quicker the object will be
serviced.)
<li>
<em>retrieve()</em>, which removes and returns the object in the queue
that has the lowest priority number.  (If multiple objects have the
lowest number, any one of the objects may be returned.)
</ul>

<p>
Here is an example, where string objects are inserted with priority numbers: 
<pre>
insert(8, "abc")
insert(3, "def")
insert(4, "ghi")
retrieve()  ("def" is returned)
insert(2, "jkl")
retrieve()  ("jkl" is returned)
insert(4, "mno")
retrieve() ("ghi" is returned)
retrieve() ("mno" is returned)
</pre>
At this point, the priority queue still holds <tt>"abc"</tt>,
whose low priority has prevented it from leaving. 


<p>
As usual, we require an implementation of a priority queue where insertion
and retrieval take time that is less than linear, in terms of the number
of objects held in the queue.  Since there is an implicit ordering
involved with insertion, we might try writing some variant of
a traditional queue that sorts its elements on insertions.  Alas, this
will produce greater than linear-time behavior.  Since the priority
numbers are not sequences of symbols, the spelling-tree technique is
not suited for the job.  We require a new approach.

<h3>Heaps</h3>

A <em>heap</em> is a <em>complete binary tree</em> that possesses the
<em>heap-order</em> property.

<p>
A binary tree is <em>complete</em> if
<ol>
<li>
all paths in the tree have length within one of the length of the
longest path.
<li>
all paths that have lengths less than the longest path's length
are rightmost within the tree.
</ol>
Here are two examples of complete binary trees:
<pre>
                  a                    c
                /   \                /   \
               b     c              b     a
              / \   / \            / \   / \
             d  e  f   .          d   .  .  .
            /\ /\ /\             / \
           . . .. . .           .   .
</pre>
Note that the shortest paths in the trees are the ones on the trees' right.
In contrast, these trees are not complete:
<pre>
                  a                    c
                /   \                /   \
               b     c              b     a
              / \   / \            / \   / \
             d  e  f   .          .   .  d  .
            /\ /\ /\                    / \
           . g .. . .                  .   .
            /\
           . .
</pre>
You can consider a complete tree as a tree where insertions must be
added in a fixed, left-to-right order, much like laying bricks:
<pre>
                  1         
                /   \      
               2     3    
              / \   / \  
             4  5  6   * 
            /\ /\ /\    
           + . .. . . 
</pre>
The leaf marked by the asterisk is the position for the next insertion,
the leaf marked by the plus symbol is the position after that, etc.


<p>
Next, a complete binary tree has the <em>heap-order</em> property if,
for every node, <tt>N</tt>, within the tree,  the priority number of the value
held within node <tt>N</tt> is less-than-or-equals all priority numbers held
within  <tt>N.left()</tt> 
and all priority numbers held within  <tt>N.right()</tt>.

<p>
Here is an example of a complete tree with the heap-order property,
where each node holds a priority number, object pair.
<pre>
                   2,r
                /       \
               7,m      3,q
              /  \      /  \
            9,p  12,k  6,w   .
            /\   /\    /\
           . .   ..   . .
</pre>
Check each node---the number at a node is less-or-equals to all the
numbers ``below'' it in the tree.   <em>This means the smallest number
must be at the root.</em>

<p>
Although this tree is heap-ordered, it is not an ordered tree (binary search
tree) ---
note where 3 is positioned, say, relative to  2 and 7.
This fact will be exploited to devise a fast algorithm for insertion.


<h4>Insertion into a heap</h4>

Insertion must add a new priority number, object pair to the heap
in such a way that the resulting structure is still a heap---it is
complete and heap-ordered.
The algorithm is simple and clever:
<p>
To insert  <tt>num, ob</tt>  into heap, <tt>h</tt>:
<ol>
<li>
Place <tt>num, ob</tt>  in a new node that replaces the leftmost leaf
nearest the root of <tt>h</tt>.
(This inserts
<tt>num, ob</tt>  into the first leaf encountered when ``reading'' the tree
left-to-right, top-down.  See the earlier drawings.)
<li>
Next, make the new node with <tt>num, ob</tt>
``bubble up'' in the tree
by repeatedly swapping the node with its parent, when the
parent's priority number is greater than <tt>num</tt>.
</ol>
Here is an example: Say that we perform  <tt>insert(1,s)</tt> into the
heap drawn above.   After Step 1 of the algorithm, we have this tree:
<pre>
                   2,r
                /       \
               7,m      3,q
              /  \      /  \
            9,p  12,k  6,w  1,s
            /\   /\    /\   /\
           . .   ..   . .  .  .
</pre>
This is a complete tree but is not heap-ordered.  To restore the latter
property, we must make  <tt>1,s</tt> ``bubble up'' to its appropriate
position.  First, we note that  <tt>1</tt> is less than <tt>3</tt>,
the priority number of the new node's parent, so we exchange nodes:
<pre>
                   2,r
                /       \
               7,m      1,s
              /  \      /  \
            9,p  12,k  6,w  3,q
            /\   /\    /\   /\
           . .   ..   . .  .  .
</pre>
An examination of the new parent to  <tt>1,s</tt> shows that another
exchange is warranted, giving us:
<pre>
                   1,s
                /       \
               7,m      2,r
              /  \      /  \
            9,p  12,k  6,w  3,q
            /\   /\    /\   /\
           . .   ..   . .  .  .
</pre>
At this point, the tree is heap-ordered.

<h4>Retrieval from a heap</h4>

A retrieval operation always returns the object in the root node
and deletes the root of the heap-ordered tree.
But this leaves two trees, which must be rebuilt into one heap.
Here is the algorithm for retrieval:

<p>
If the heap is empty, this is an error.  Otherwise:
<ol>
<li>
Extract the object in the root and save it; call it <tt>ob_root</tt>.
<li>
Move to the root the rightmost node that is furthest from the original root.
(This rebuilds the tree so that it is again complete.)
<li>
Say that
<tt>num, ob</tt> now reside at the root.  Make this node
``bubble down'' the tree
by repeatedly swapping it with a child whose priority number is less than
<tt>num</tt>.  If both children have priority numbers that
are less than <tt>num</tt>, then swap the node with the smaller-valued
child.
<li>
Return <tt>ob_root</tt> as the result.
</ol>
Here is an example: Given the tree just drawn, say that a retrieval must
be done.  Step 1 says that we extract object <tt>s</tt> and save it.
Step 2 says to replace the root with the node that is furthest and rightmost
from the root.  This gives us:
<pre>
                   3,q
                /       \
               7,m      2,r
              /  \      /  \
            9,p  12,k  6,w  .
            /\   /\    /\  
           . .   ..   . . 
</pre>
Step 3 says that <tt>3,q</tt> must be exchanged with its children,
as necessary, to restore heap-ordering.  Here,  <tt>3,q</tt> is
exchanged with  <tt> 2,r</tt>, giving us:
<pre>
                   2,r
                /       \
               7,m      3,q
              /  \      /  \
            9,p  12,k  6,w  .
            /\   /\    /\   
           . .   ..   . . 
</pre>
Only one exchange is needed.  <tt>s</tt> is returned.

<h4>Time complexity</h4>

The insertion and retrieval operations each take
time of the order,  <tt>log<sub>2</sub>N</tt>, where the heap contains
<tt>N</tt> nodes.   This is because only one path of the heap is traversed
during the ``bubble up'' and ``bubble down'' operations.

<p>
The challenging aspect of implementing a heap structure lies in
remembering which node is the deepest, rightmost, and which leaf is
the shallowest, leftmost.   Both of these notions are tied to
the count of objects held in the heap:  If we number the positions
of the heap in binary numbering,
<pre>
<img src="tree1.gif">
</pre>
then the shallowest, leftmost leaf is the position that is one plus
the count of objects in the heap, and the deepest, rightmost node
is located at the position that is exactly the same as the count of
objects in the heap.

<p>
Since each binary numeral indicates a path from the root of the heap
to the position numbered by it,
<pre>
<img src="tree2.gif">
</pre>
we can easily locate the leftmost leaf and rightmost node with
simple binary arithmetic, where the calculation of the binary numeral
and the path traversal based on the numeral both take
on the order
of <tt>log<sub>2</sub>N</tt> time.
