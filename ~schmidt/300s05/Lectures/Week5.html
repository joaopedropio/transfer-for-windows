<h2>Queues</h2>

<p>
Another classic data structure is the <em>queue</em>.  A queue
differs from a stack in the way its removal operation behaves---a
removal removes and returns
the element that has resided in the queue for the longest
period of time.  For this reason, a queue is called a
``first in, first out'' data structure.

<p>
It is helpful to think of a queue as a ``pipeline'', where objects
enter from the rear, wait in line, and exit from the front:
<pre>
               +------------------------+
   enter --->  )   )    )    )    )     ) --->  exit
               +------------------------+
</pre>


<h4>Queues for resource management</h4>
<p>
Queues are used when multiple objects wish to use a ``resource,''
but only one object can use the resource at a time.
A real-life example of a queue is the line of people who wait at the
bank to interact with a teller---one person deals with the teller (the
``resource''), and
the others order themselves so that the person who has waited
the longest goes next.

<p>
A computer's operating system uses queue data structures
to manage the computer's resources.  Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li>
<em>the printer:</em>  the OS uses 
a ``print queue''
to hold the identities of the processes (executing user programs)
that wish to use the printer.  Once a process starts using the printer,
it is allowed to continue until it is completely finished.  The other
processes that wish to use the printer must wait, and their IDs (and
the address of the file to print) are
kept in the queue.  When the process using the printer finishes, the
process kept waiting longest in the queue is retrieved, and its
print job is started.
<li>
<em>the internal (``hard'') disk drive</em>: a disk can perform at
most one read or write at any one instant, so the OS uses a queue to
hold processes's requests (the ID of the process and the details about
the read/write) to read or write from a sector on disk.
The disk's controller repeately retrieves from the queue the next
request ``in line'' and performs it.  (When there are no more requests,
the controller ``sleeps''.)
<li>
<em>the process queue:</em> Recall from the lecture notes about operating
systems that the CPU itself is managed by the OS with the aid of
a process queue.  The process queue contains the IDs of all processes
that are ready to execute.  The OS
retrieves a ready process's ID from
the process queue, loads that process's instruction number and data information
into the CPU's registers, and starts the CPU to execute 
the process's instructions for
some designated ``time slice.''  At the end of the time slice,
the ID of the executing process is inserted at the end of the
process queue, the information in the registers for the process
is saved (in the process's process control block --- see the OS notes),
and the ID of another ready process is retrieved from the process queue.
</ul>
Without queues, an operating system could not operate!

<h4>Queues for simulations</h4>

<p>
A classic programming application that
uses queues is a <em>simulation</em>, where a real-life
activity is modelled by objects.   For example, if we wanted to simulate
the airplane traffic at an airport, we use an object
to model the airport's runway---this is the ``resource'' used
by airplanes to take off and land, and at most one airplane can use
the resource at a time.  The airplanes are objects;
an airplane resides either in the air, waiting to land, or on the ground,
waiting to leave.   The simulation places the airplanes waiting
to land within a ``landing queue'' and the airplanes waiting to leave
in a ``take-off queue,'' producing a situation like that in the
following drawing:
<pre>
           Landing queue
           ----------------------------
Plane ---> )Plane ) Plane ) ... ) Plane) ---+
           -----------------------------     \ lands
                                              \
                                               v
                                            Runway ---> (exits simulation)
                                               ^
                   Take-off queue             / leaves
                   ---------------------     /
        Plane ---> )Plane ) ... ) Plane)----+
                   ---------------------
</pre>
The simulation's controller
creates planes that enter the simulation,
either from the air or from the ground, and it inserts each plane into the
appropriate queue.  When the runway is unused, the controller
removes a plane from
a queue and gives it the resource.  When the plane completes its use
of the resource, the controller removes the plane from the simulation
and counts it in the simulation's ``throughput.''

<p>
Such a simulation can be used with various algorithms
for using the runway to see which algorithm produces maximum ``throughput''
of planes.


<h4>Queues for communication and manufacturing</h4>

<p>
Queues often participate directly in computation, especially in
manufacturing.
Consider a ``print shop'', which must ``manufacture'' lines of
colored text, from inputs of text and colors:
From one input source (a ``producer'') a sequence of text lines is
received; from a second input source, a sequence of color selections
is received.  The print shops matches each text line to each color and
manufactures a line of colored text:
<pre>
PRODUCER OF      +-----------+
TEXT LINES  ---> )   )   )   ) ---> --+  
                 +-----------+        |
                                    PRINT SHOP ---> sequence of
PRODUCER OF      +-----------+        |              colored text
COLORS    -----> )   )   )   ) ---> --+               lines 
                 +-----------+
</pre>
The text lines and colors arrive at different rates, so they are
entered and saved in queues.  The print shop extracts
a text line from one queue and a color from the other queue
and combines them into a line of colored text, which it prints.

<p>
At
<a href="QueueEx.html"><tt>www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300f04/Lectures/QueueEx</tt></a>
is a small demo program that implements a simple version of the
print-shop ``game.''
The program is a bit simplistic in that it
asks two humans (and not two other computer processes)
to be the producers of the text and colors, but the program illustrates
well the importance of queues to the print shop.

<p>
The above example also suggests how queues can be used to pass
messages (communications)  from one agent to another in a system.
Agents can read and write messages at different speeds, and the queues
ensure that no messages are lost.

Figure 10 shows an implementation of a queue that uses a linked list.
<pre>FIGURE 10: implementation of a queue====================================

/** Queue implements a queue */
public class Queue
{ private Cell front;  // marks the first Cell of the queue
  private Cell rear;   // marks the last Cell of the queue

  /** Constructor Queue creates an empty queue */
  public Queue()
  { front = null;
    rear = null;
  }

  /** enqueue  inserts a new element to the end of the queue

  public void enqueue(Object ob)
  { Cell c = new Cell(ob, null);
    if ( front == null )  // is the queue empty?
       { front = c; }     // if true, then set front to  c
    else { rear.setNext(c); }  // else, attach  c  to the rear of the queue
    rear = c;
  }

 /** dequeue  removes the element from the front of the queue

  public Object dequeue()
  { if ( front == null )
       { throw new RuntimeException("Queue error: queue empty"); }
    Object answer = front.getVal();
    if ( front == rear )  // queue contains just this one element?
       { rear = null; }   // if true, then set queue to empty
    front = front.getNext();
    return answer;
  }

 /** getFront returns the identity of the queue's front element

  public Object getFront()
  { if ( front == null )
       { throw new RuntimeException("Queue error: queue empty"); }
    return front.getVal();
  }

  /** isEmpty  states whether the queue has 0 elements.
    * @return whether the stack has no elements  */
  public boolean isEmpty()
  { return (front == null); }
}

ENDFIGURE================================================================</pre>
We create a queue, <tt>q</tt>, and add the strings
<tt>"a"</tt>, <tt>"b"</tt>, and <tt>"c"</tt> to it by stating,
<pre>
Queue q = new Queue();
q.enqueue("a");
q.enqueue("b");
q.enqueue("c");
</pre>
At this point, element <tt>"a"</tt> resides at the front of the 
queue, and <tt>"c"</tt> rests at the rear.  The configuration
in storage looks like this:
<pre>
           ----
Queue q ==| a1 |
           ----
 a1 : Queue
 -------------------
 | Cell front ==| a2 |
 |               -----
 | Cell rear ==| a4 |
 |  ...         ----

  a2 : Cell                a3 : Cell                   a4 : Cell
 ------------              ------------               ------------
 | Object val ==| "a" |    | Object val ==| "b" |    | Object val ==| "c" |
 |               -----     |               -----     |               -----
 | Cell next ==| a3 |      | Cell next ==| a4 |      | Cell next ==| null |
 |              ------     |              -----      |              -----
 |  ...                    |  ...                    | ...
</pre>
At this point the message, <tt>q.dequeue()</tt>, would return <tt>"a"</tt>
and reset <tt>front</tt> to <tt>a3</tt>.

<h3>Iterative operations on linked-list implementations of queues</h3>

The most elegant implementation of a queue is with a linked list of
cells (although with some effort, you can use arrays to implement queues).
The links in the cells suggest a natural order for examining the
queue's contents--from front to rear.  For practice, here is
an additional method,  <tt>lengthOf</tt>, that we might insert into
<tt>class Queue</tt>:
<pre>
/** lengthOf returns the number of objects held in the queue
  * @return the length  */
public int lengthOf()
{ int length = 0;
  Cell current = front;
  while ( current != null )
        // invariant: length holds the number of cells from the queue's
        //   front up to, but not including, the  current  one
       { length = length + 1;
         current = current.getNext();
       }
  return length;
}
</pre>
Although there is another, simpler way of maintaining and returning
a queue's length (hint: declare another private field,
<tt>private int length</tt>), the point of the
<tt>lengthOf</tt> coding is that <em>there is a standard pattern for
traversing and processing the elements of a linked list</em>:
It uses a loop and a variable, <tt>current</tt>, that examines the
cells in the list one by one.

<p>
Here is another queue method:
<pre>
/** toString  calculates a string representation the queue's contents.
  * @return the string  */
public String toString()
{ String answer = ""
  Cell current = front;
  while ( current != null )
        // invariant:  answer contains the string representations of the
        //  objects from the front cell up to, non including,  current
        { answer = answer + " " + current.getVal().toString();
          current = current.getNext();
        }
  return answer;
}
</pre>
Again, the same pattern of loop traverses the list's cells.
This pattern is a classic one and is well worth remembering.

<h4>Coding a queue with an array</h4>

It is possible to build a queue with an array.   Here are some
pictures to give the idea: We configure the queue with two integer
variables, <tt>front</tt> and <tt>rear</tt>, and an array.
An empty queue is implemented something like this:
<pre>
.           +-----+
int front : |  -1 |
.           +-----+
int rear :  |  -1 |
.           +-----+
.                 0      1      2      3
.             +------+------+------+------+
Object[] q :  | null | null | null | null |
.             +------+------+------+------+
</pre>
Say that objects <tt>a, b</tt>, and <tt>c</tt> are enqueued.
The array fills up like this:
<pre>
.           +-----+
int front : |  0  |
.           +-----+
int rear :  |   2 |
.           +-----+
.                 0      1      2      3
.             +------+------+------+------+
Object[] q :  |   a  |    b |    c | null |
.             +------+------+------+------+
</pre>
Next, say that a single dequeue operation is performed.
The queue's internal structure looks like this:
<pre>
.           +-----+
int front : |  1  |
.           +-----+
int rear :  |   2 |
.           +-----+
.                 0      1      2      3
.             +------+------+------+------+
Object[] q :  | null |    b |    c | null |
.             +------+------+------+------+
</pre>
Now, say that two more objects, <tt>d</tt> and <tt>e</tt> are
enqueued.  In this situation, there is a ``wrap-around'' of the
array:
<pre>
.           +-----+
int front : |  1  |
.           +-----+
int rear :  |   0 |
.           +-----+
.                 0      1      2      3
.             +------+------+------+------+
Object[] q :  |   e  |    b |    c |   d  |
.             +------+------+------+------+
</pre>
At this point, a dequeue operation would extract the object
at array cell, 1.  An enqueue operation would cause an error,
and indeed, this is the main disadvantage of using an array to
code a queue --- the queue can fill up.

<p>
As an exercise, you should code a version of <tt>class Queue</tt>
that uses an array.  Take care to monitor when the queue is completely
full, when the queue holds exactly one object, and when it is empty.
(Do this by checking the values of <tt>front</tt> and <tt>rear</tt>.)


<h3>Queues facilitate breadth-first search</h3>

<p>
A queue can be used to conduct a <em>breadth-first search</em>
of a tree, where the nodes inside a tree are examined in the order 
of closeness to the tree's root (START) node.
Recall, from the lecture on stacks, that the search tree in Figure 5 listed the
choices for generating permutations of four letters, and a stack was
used in Figure 6 to construct a depth-first search.
Figure 11 shows how to use a queue for a breadth-first search of the
same tree.
The front of the queue is portrayed at the left, and the queue's rear
is shown at the right.
<pre>FIGURE 11: breadth-first search=========================================

Current node   Queue (front to rear)

START          (empty)

a              b c d    (examine 'a'; save 'b', 'c', 'd')

b              c d ab ac ad  (save the nodes underneath 'a' and examine 'b')

c              d ab ac ad ba bc bd  (again, save the nodes under 'b')

d              ab ac ad ba bc bd ca cb cd

ab             ac ad ba bc bd ca cb cd da db dc

ac             ad ba bc bd ca cb cd da db dc abc abd

ad             ba bc bd ca cb cd da db dc abc abd acb acd

ba             bc bd ca cb cd da db dc abc abd acb acd adb adc  

etc.

ENDFIGURE==============================================================</pre>

<p>
The traversal moves quickly across the breadth of the 
tree, saving lower-depth nodes for later examination.  The
queue ensures that the node that is removed for next
examination is at the same breadth, whenever possible, as the
node just examined.
Contrast Figure 11 with Figure 6, whose stack delivers a node
at a lower depth whenever possible.

<p>
Depth-first search proves useful for computer players of games where
there are many possible next moves and many possible combinations of
moves (e.g., chess). 
Such a situation makes it infeasible to consider all possible
outcomes of all possible sequences of moves, and a (partial) breadth-first
search calculates
all partial sequences of moves, instead.
For example, if the search tree in Figure 5 listed the sequences of
moves in a ``spelling game,'' then the sixth configuration
in Figure 11 holds
all possible two-move sequences.
At this point, the search could be stopped, and the queue examined
for the best possible move based on this partial knowledge of the
entire tree.

<h4>Demonstration program</h4>


Here is the two-player colors/text game that uses queues that was
demonstrated in the lecture:
<h4>
<a href="QueueEx.html"><tt>www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300f04/Lectures/QueueEx</tt></a>
</h4>

The game used two queues---one held Player 1's submitted lines of text
and the other held Player 2's submitted sequence of colors.  The
queues were constructed from  <tt>class Queue</tt>, which appears in
<tt>package Queue</tt> in the above game.

<h2>Iterative and Recursive Processing of Linked Lists</h2>

Both stack and queue data structures are elegantly defined with
linked lists.  In general, linked lists are used to 
model collections where elements are not ``indexed'' or
``keyed'' but are retrieved in some fixed order (e.g., oldest first or
youngest first).

<p>
Perhaps the standard processing one does to a linked list is traverse
its cells and compute on each of the values held in the cells.
Given <tt>class Cell</tt>, we might write
the following method that counts the number of cells in a linked
list by traversing the list from front to back:
<pre>
  /** lengthOf calculates the number of cells in a linked list
    * @param l - the leading cell of the list
    * @return the length of the linked list  */
  public int lengthOf(Cell l)
  { int length = 0;
    Cell c = l;
    while ( c != null )
          // invariant:  lengthOf(l) == length + lengthOf(c)
          { length = length +1;
            c = c.getNext();
          }
   return length;
  }
</pre>
The loop's invariant suggests that there is a recursion in the basic notion
of traversing the loop.  Indeed, 
<em>because <tt>class Cell</tt> is defined in terms of itself</em>,
a simpler solution to the above problem is written with a recursively
defined method:
<pre>
  /** lengthOf calculates the number of cells in a linked list
    * @param l - the leading cell of the list
    * @return the length of the linked list  */
  public int lengthOf(Cell l)
  { int length = 0;
    if ( l == null )
         { length = 0; }
    else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
    return length;
  }
</pre>
The method is based on the natural and obviously correct notion that
the length of a linked list is the length of the lead cell (namely, 1)
added to length of the rest of the list.

<p>
The general pattern for linked-list processing goes as follows:
<pre>
recursivelyProcess(Cell l)
{ if ( l == null )
       { compute answer for an empty list }
  else { extract  l.getVal()  and compute on it;
         get result of  recursivelyProcess(l.getNext());
         combine the two preceding values into the complete answer;
       }
  return the answer;
}
</pre>
This pattern of computing is perfectly matched to the internal structure
of <tt>class Cell</tt>:
<pre>
public class Cell
{ private Object value;
  private Cell next:
   ...
  public Object getVal() { return value; }
  public Object getnext() { return next; }
}
</pre>

When you use the pattern for linked-list processing, you are guaranteed
that you will cover both possible forms of linked list (namely, the
null-list and a list of Cells), and you are guaranteed that the
method must terminate (assuming that the linked list has been correctly
assembled in the first place).

<p>
These ideas prove useful when we later define and process data structures that
utilize self-reference in their internal attributes.

<p><hr><p>

<h4>Immutable Data Structures</h4>

A crucial problem is concatenating two linked lists.
(This might be done when coding a ``set union'' operation, where
each set is modelled as a linked list.) 
<pre>
/** concat constructs a list that is its two arguments connected together.
  * @param l1 - the first list
  * @param l2 - the second list
  * @return the address of the concatenated list  */
public Cell concat(Cell l1, Cell l2)
</pre>
It is tempting to code this method so that the rear cell of <tt>l1</tt>
is linked to the front cell of <tt>l2</tt>, and the method returns the
address of
<tt>l1</tt> as its result.
But this usually
leads to disaster, as shown here:
<pre>
Cell x = ... a list of three cells ...;
Cell y = ... a list of two cells ...;
Cell z = concat(x, y);   // concat connects x to y and returns x as its result
System.out.println(lengthOf(x));   // prints 5, which is very wrong!
</pre>
Alas, the simple-minded solution ruins <tt>x</tt>---the
<tt>concat</tt> method <em>should not
alter the structure of either of its two parameters when constructing
its result.</em>  (This is a valuable rule to follow in object-oriented
programming---never change the values of any of the arguments to a method.
If you violate this rule, you are asking for lots of errors
when the parameters are referenced later.)

<p>
In worst case, <tt>concat</tt> might be written so that
it constructs a brand new list by traversing all of <tt>l1</tt> and copying
its values into new cells and then traversing all of <tt>l2</tt> and
copying its values into new cells.
Such a method is painful to write and it wastes the opportunity to share
cells that are already constructed (which was what we were trying to
do in the first coding of <tt>concat</tt>).

<p>
Say that we banished the <tt>setNext</tt> method from <tt>class Cell</tt>.
This makes it impossible to change the private fields of any cell once
it is constructed.  Perhaps surprisingly,
by making <tt>class Cell</tt> more restrictive, we can do more sharing
of its objects.  Specifically,
there is a beautiful way of
concatenating two lists that employs maximal sharing of the cells that
already exist:
<pre>
/** append constructs a list that is its two arguments connected together.
  * @param xs - the first list
  * @param ys - the second list
  * @return the address of the concatenated list  */
public Cell append(Cell xs, Cell ys)
{ Cell answer;
  if ( xs == null )
       { answer = ys; }
  else { Cell c = append(xs.getNext(), ys);
         answer = new Cell(xs.getVal(), c);   
       }
  return answer;
}
</pre>
This solution constructs a linked list that consists of
copies of <tt>xs</tt>'s cells and sharing of
all of <tt>ys</tt>.  <em>Assuming that <tt>setnext</tt> is
disallowed</em>, this is safe because there is no
way to change one list and
affect another:
<pre>
Cell x = ... a list of three cells ...;
Cell y = ... a list of two cells ...;
Cell z = append(x, y);   // returns a new list that has x's values and shares y
System.out.println(lengthOf(x));   // prints 3
System.out.println(lengthOf(y));   // prints 2
System.out.println(lengthOf(z));   // prints 5
</pre>

<p>
A data type is <em>immutable</em> if its objects cannot be changed
once they are constructed.  (That is, the values in an object's
fields cannot be changed.)  Immutable objects can be shared by
multiple variables (or multiple objects or multiple data structures),
because no variable has the means for altering the shared object.

<p>
Note that the versions of <tt>class Stack</tt> and <tt>class Queue</tt>
in Chapter 12 define mutable data types.  It is often simpler and safer
to program with immutable types, so we will study next how these are defined.

<h4>Inductive Data Types</h4>

This material is related to Section 12.4, Chapter 12, of the CIS200 notes.

<p>
We used <tt>class Cell</tt> to implement or <em>model</em> a data type
of lists.  It is time to define precisely what a list data type is.
The classic name for it is a <em>cons list</em>:

<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>ConsList</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is the object, <tt>Nil</tt>; or
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>Cons(h, t)</tt>, where <tt>h</tt> is an
<tt>Object</tt> and <tt>t</tt> is
another <tt>ConsList</tt>-object.
</ul>
</dl>
This form of definition is called an <em>inductive definition</em>.

In lecture, we modelled <tt>Nil</tt>-objects with the Java value,
<tt>null</tt>, and we modelled <tt>Cons(h, t)</tt>-objects with the
phrase,  <tt>new Cell(h, t)</tt>.

<p>
Using our more formal terminology, a conslist consisting of "a", "b",
and "c" is this structure:
<pre>
Cons("a", Cons("b", Cons("c", Nil)))
</pre>
Whether this is implemented with <tt>null</tt> and <tt>Cell</tt>
is a coding decision---<tt>class Cell</tt> is <em>not</em> the same
as the data type, <tt>ConsList</tt>.  (We see why, later.)

<p>
When a data type is defined with an inductive definition, 
<em>computation on elements of the data type is also defined
inductively</em>, and this is implemented by means of a recursively
defined method.  Here are examples:
<pre>
/** length of  a ConsList:  */
lengthOf(Nil) = 0
lengthOf( Cons(h, t) ) =  1 + lengthOf(t)
</pre>
This set of equations, <em>one per clause in the inductive definition</em>,
makes clear how to write a Java method that computes <tt>lengthOf</tt>.

<p>
<pre>
/** summing integers in a Conslist:  */
summation(Nil) = 0
summation( Cons(h, t) ) =  h + summation(t)
</pre>

<p>
<pre>
/** appending one list to another:  */
append(Nil, ys) = ys
append(Cons(h, t),  ys) =  Cons(h, append(t, ys))
</pre>


<p>
Other data types can be defined by means of inductive definition.
Here are three more classic examples:

<h4>Binary numerals</h4>

<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>BinaryNumeral</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is the object, <tt>0</tt>; or
<li>
it is the object, <tt>1</tt>; or
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>[N]0</tt>, where <tt>N</tt> is an existing
<tt>BinaryNumeral</tt> object.  (Usually, we write this as just <tt>N0</tt>.)
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>[N]1</tt>, where <tt>N</tt> is an existing
<tt>BinaryNumeral</tt> object.  (Usually, we write this as just <tt>N1</tt>.)
</ul>
</dl>
For example, the binary numeral 13, normally written as 1101,
has this internal structure:  <tt>[[[1]1]0]1</tt>
The internal structure is important, because it is exploited in the
wiring of arithmetic operations into a computer chip.

<p>
<pre>
/** computing the decimal value of a BinaryNumber:  */
valueOf(0) = 0
valueOf(1) = 1
valueOf([N]0) = 2 * valueOf(N)
valueOf([N]1) = (2 * valueOf(N)) + 1
</pre>

<h4>Booleans</h4>

<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>boolean</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is the object, <tt>false</tt>; or
<li>
it is the object, <tt>true</tt>
</ul>
</dl>
Although there is no recursion in the inductive definition, the same
principles apply when designing operations on elements of the type:
<pre>
negation(false) = true
negation(true) = false

and(false, B) = false   (for any boolean, B)
and(true, B) = B        (for any boolean, B)

or(false, B) = B        (for any boolean, B)
or(true, B) = true      (for any boolean, B)
</pre>

<h4>Binary Trees</h4>

<dl>
<dd>
An object is a <tt>BinaryTree</tt>-object if
<ul>
<li>
it is the object, <tt>Leaf</tt>; or
<li>
it is a structure, <tt>Node(v, l, r)</tt>, where <tt>v</tt> is an
<tt>Object</tt>, and <tt>l</tt> and <tt>r</tt> are already existing
<tt>BinaryTree</tt>-objects.
</ul>
</dl>
Such trees will be extensively used in future weeks.
