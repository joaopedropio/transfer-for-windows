<h2>Mutable trees, parent links, and node deletions </h2>

A <em>mutable tree</em> is a tree in which you can change the values and
subtrees of its nodes.  Let <tt>MutableTree</tt> be the data-type name
of mutable binary trees.

<p>
The <tt>Node</tt> objects used in mutable trees contain the usual
methods plus these new ones:
<pre>
public void setValue(Object v)

public void setLeft(MutableTree t)

public void setRight(MutableTree t)
</pre>
Of course, these are used to reset a node's value and links to left
and right subtrees. 

<p>
<em>Important:  When using mutable trees, you cannot
share nodes or leaves!</em>   If a node is shared by two distinct
trees, and you alter the node's value or link, this affects both of the
trees that share the node.  The outcome is almost always wrong.

<h4>When to use mutable trees</h4>

The main motivation for using mutable trees is to avoid construction
of lots of new Nodes when inserting and deleting elements.
In particular, Node deletion becomes far simpler.

<p>
You can
implement an application with mutable trees if both of the following
hold true:
<ol>
<li>
The application maintains only <em>one</em> tree, and there is never a
need to make copies of the tree, to ``undo'' changes to the tree, to
``backtrack'' to an earlier version, nor to share nodes/leaves/subtrees.
<li>
The values in the tree's nodes must be frequently changed
<em>or</em> nodes are frequently deleted <em>or</em> subtrees are
frequently rearranged.
</ol>
If you are uncertain if both (1) and (2) hold, then play it safe
and use immutable trees.

<h4>Mutable trees have parents</h4>

Because mutable trees are used when there are frequent changes,
the frequent changes should be done relatively efficiently.
When a node must be moved,
it is valuable
for a node to hold the address of its <em>parent</em> node, that is,
the node that links to the node that must be moved---this
lets us change the parent's
link, too.  For this reason,
we will add an extra attribute to every leaf and node---the address
of its parent.  This motivates two more methods for both
leaves and nodes:
<pre>
/** parent  returns (the address of) this tree's parent node */
public Node parent()

/** setParent  tells this tree to remember that it has a  new_parent  */
public void setParent(Node new_parent)
</pre>
Here is a picture of a mutable tree, rooted at address <tt>a1</tt>,
that holds the values,
<tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>c</tt> along with parent links:
<pre>
        a1: Node
              value = "a"
              parent = null
              left = a2
              right = a3

    a2: Node                a3: Node
          value = "b"             value = "c"
          parent = a1             parent = a1
          left = a4               left = a6
          right = a5              right = a7

a4: Leaf                    a6: Leaf
      parent = a2                 parent = a3

a5: Leaf                    a7: Leaf
      parent = a2                 parent = a3
</pre>

We might draw a terse picture of these objects as
<pre> 
         a1: a
       /^    ^\  
      v |    | v 
    a2: b    a3: c
    /^  ^\    /^  ^\
   v |  | v  v |  | v
   a4   a5    a6   a7
</pre>
where the down-pointing arrows denote the left- and right-subtree links,
and the up-pointing arrows denote the parent links.


<p>
Here is a quick summary of <tt>class MutableTree</tt>:
<pre>
/** MutableTree defines the data type of binary trees that can be altered
  *   once they are constructed.  Important: substructures of this form
  *   of tree _cannot_ be shared!
  * Forms of this tree are intended to be:  
  *  (i) a leaf,  which holds the address of its parent node (if any), or 
  *  (ii) a node that holds a value, a left subtree, a right subtree,
  *       and the address of its parent node (if any).  */
public abstract class MutableTree
{ // accessor methods:
  public Object value()
  public MutableTree left()
  public MutableTree right()
  public Node parent()

  // mutator methods:
  public void setValue(Object v)
  public void setLeft(MutableTree t)
  public void setRight(MutableTree t)
  public void setParent(Node p)
}
</pre>
The coding of a leaf looks like this:
<pre>
/** Leaf models a tree leaf---an empty tree  */
public class Leaf extends MutableTree
{ private Node my_parent;

  /** Constructor Leaf constructs the empty tree 
    * @param p - this node's parent  */
  public Leaf(Node p)
  { my_parent = p; }
 ...
}
</pre>
and a node looks like this:
<pre>
/** Node models a nonempty tree node, holding a value, two subtrees, and
  *  a link to this Node's parent Node  */
public class Node extends MutableTree
{ private Object val;
  private MutableTree left;
  private MutableTree right;
  private Node my_parent;

  /** Constructor Node constructs the tree node
    * @param p - this node's parent node
    * @param v - the value held in the node
    * @param l - the left subtree
    * @param r - the right subtree  */
  public Node(Node p, Object v, MutableTree l, MutableTree r)
  { my_parent = p;
    val = v;
    left = l;
    right = r;
  }
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>
Here are some basic actions on mutable trees.
First, lets build a Node that holds "b" and two leaves:
<pre>
Leaf empty1 = new Leaf(null);
Leaf empty2 = new Leaf(null);
Node btree = new Node(null, "b", empty1, empty2);
empty1.setParent(btree);   // connect leaves to parent node
empty2.setParent(btree)
</pre>
Notice that the parent links in the leaves must be set.

<p>
The above steps are tedious and are best placed in a helper method:
<pre>
/** makeNewNode builds a Node that holds  value  and links to  parent */
public Node makeNewNode(Node parent, Object value)
{ Leaf empty1 = new Leaf(null);
  Leaf empty2 = new Leaf(null);
  Node new_node = new Node(parent, value, empty1, empty2);
  empty1.setParent(new_node);   // connect leaves to parent node
  empty2.setParent(new_node);
  return new_node;
}
</pre>
Next, let's make another Node, holding <tt>"c"</tt>, and
then connect the two nodes to yet another that holds <tt>"a"</tt>:
<pre>
Node ctree = makeNewNode(null, "c");  // build a tree that holds just "c"
Node atree = new Node(null, "a", btree, ctree);
btree.setParent(atree);
ctree.setParent(atree);
</pre>

<p>
Although setting the parent links is a bother, the links pay handsomely
when we must delete a node from the tree.  Say that
we must delete <tt>btree</tt>, replacing it
by a leaf.  We can do this
without traversing the tree to find <tt>btree</tt>'s position:
<pre>
Node bparent = btree.parent();
if ( bparent != null )  // verify that  btree  is not the root
   { Leaf replacement = new Leaf(bparent); 
     if ( bparent.left() == btree )  // is btree its parent's left subtree?
          { bparent.setLeft(replacement); }
     else // it's the right subtree of its parent:
          { bparent.setRight(replacement); }
   }
</pre>

<h4>Methods for mutable trees</h4>


Let's start with a standard example---inserting a value, <tt>u</tt>, into an
ordered tree.  Say there is a variable,
named <tt>the_ordered_tree</tt>,
that holds (the address of)
the tree to be altered.
Here is a simple strategy, based on the technique we used with immutable
trees:
<pre>
private MutableTree the_ordered_tree;
  ...
the_ordered_tree = insert(u, the_ordered_tree);
</pre>
where the <tt>insert</tt> method is defined as follows:
<pre>
/** insert  places  u  into its proper position in tree  t,
  *  and returns the address of the altered tree.  (This is usually just
  *  t  itself, unless  t  is a Leaf, in which case it must be replaced
  *  by a new Node.)  */
public MutableTree insert(Record u, MutableTree t)
{ MutableTree answer;
  if ( t instanceof Leaf )
     { answer = makeNewNode(null, u); } // see  makeNewNode  above
  else // t  is a Node:
     { Record v = t.value();
       if ( u.getKey() < v.getKey() ) // remember to properly recode  <
            { MutableTree new_left = insert(u, t.left());
              // attach the revised left subtree to  t:
              new_left.setParent(t);
              t.setLeft(new_left);
            }
       else // u.getKey() >= v.getKey() :
            { MutableTree new_right = insert(u, t.right());
              new_right.setParent(t);
              t.setRight(new_right);
            }
       answer = t;  
     }
  return answer;
}
</pre>
 
<!--
Or, we might rewrite the above to use a loop to search for the
Leaf that must be replaced in the tree:
<pre>
public void insert(Object u, MutableTree t)
{ MutableTree current = t;
  boolean found_leaf = false;
  boolean we_branched_to_the_left = false;  // remembers previous branch step
  Node new_node = makeNewNode(null, u);  // the Node we will attach
  while ( !found_leaf )
        { if ( current instanceof Leaf)
               { if (  ?????//
if ( u < current.value() )  // insert to the left?
             { if ( current.left() instanceof Leaf )  // insert here?
                    { found_leaf = true; }
               else { current = current.left(); }
             }
          else // u >= current.value(), so insert to the right:
             { if ( current.right() instanceof Leaf ) // insert here?
                    { found_leaf = true; }
               else { current = current.right(); }
             }
        }
  // we know that we must insert immediately underneath the  current  node:
  if ( u < current.value() )
     { current.setLeft( new Node(u, new Leaf(), new Leaf()) ); }
  else
     { current.setRight( new Node(u, new Leaf(), new Leaf()) ); }
}
-->

<!--
<p>
Another strategy is to write <tt>insert</tt> so that it does not
return the address of the altered tree.  Instread, the
<tt>insert</tt> method operates on <tt>the_ordered_tree</tt>
as a ``global variable'':
<pre>
private MutableTree the_ordered_tree;
  ...
insert(u);  // this alters  the_ordered_tree  directly
</pre>

<pre>
/** insert  places  u  into its proper position in the_ordered_tree 
  * @param u - the value to be inserted into the_ordered_tree  */
public void insert(u)
{ if ( the_ordered_tree  is an instanceof  Leaf )
       { the_ordered_tree = makeNewNode(null, r); } // see  makeNewNode  above
  else // the_ordered_tree  is a Node, so we must descend into
       //  the_ordered_tree  to find the position where we will attach u:
       { attachValue(u, the_ordered_tree); }  // see below
}
</pre>
Next, we write a helper method,
<tt>attachValue</tt>, that looks inside <tt>the_ordered_tree</tt>
and finds the correct position for <tt>u</tt>.
When the position is located, then a new node is constructed and
attached to the position:
<pre>
/** attachValue  is a helper method that places  u  in its correct position
  *   within a non-Leaf subtree,  t  */
private void attachValue(Record u, MutableTree t)
{ // t  is known to be a  Node, so go straight to work on it;
  if ( u < t.value() )
       // if true, then  u  is inserted into t's left subtree:
       { if ( t.left() instanceof Leaf )  // but, is the left subtree a leaf?
              // if true, then we make a new node with u in it and alter
              //  t  to link to this new node:
              { Node new_node = makeNewNode(t, u);
                t.setLeft(new_node);
              }
         else // t.left() isn't a leaf, so we must descend deeper to the left:
              { attachValue(u, t.left()); }
       }

  else //  u >= t.value(), so insert into  t's  right subtree:
       { if ( t.right() instanceof Leaf )
             { Node new_node = makeNewNode(t, u);
               t.setRight(new_node);
             } 
         else { attachValue(u, t.right()); }
       }
}
</pre>
-->
The method asks the usual questions to decide whether to attach into the
left subtree or the right one.  When a Leaf is finally found at the
correct position for attachment, the Leaf is replaced by a new Node
that holds <tt>u</tt>.
Notice that
<em>
we construct only one new node</em>---the node that holds <tt>u</tt>---and
<em>we reset only one link</em>,
the link to <tt>u</tt>'s parent.  We do not
reassemble the tree as we did when we worked with immutable trees;
the updating of <tt>the_ordered_tree</tt> is done ``in place.''

<p>
With a bit of effort, you can rewrite <tt>insert</tt> so that it uses
a loop to traverse the path from the root to the Leaf that must
be replaced by the new Node and its value, <tt>u</tt>.
(Review this technique from the previous lecture.)

A package, <tt>MutableOrderedTree</tt>, has been written for constructing
mutable
ordered trees.  The package contains methods for insertion,
finding, and deletion.

<h4>Deletion of a node from a mutable tree</h4>
Deletion of nodes from an immutable tree is painful and should be
avoided if possible.  If you must do deletions, then try to work with
a mutable, ordered tree.  To do a deletion, tackle the problem in two steps:
<ol>
<li>
Find the node that holds the value to be deleted.  The node you locate
is at the root of some subtree, <tt>t</tt>, embedded within the overall tree.
<li>
Given tree <tt>t</tt>, remove its root node and return the address
of the tree you reassemble with <tt>t</tt>'s left and right subtrees.
Attach this address to <tt>t</tt>'s parent.
</ol>
We already know how to find values in a tree, so we take Step (1)
as solved.
What remains is writing an algorithm for
deleting the root of a (sub)tree that is mutable and ordered,
building an ordered tree from what's left, and returning the address
of the rebuilt tree.  (The address is then linked to the parent.)

<h4>Naive deletion algorithm</h4>
<P>
Say that tree <tt>t</tt> has the root node, <tt>N</tt>, a left subtree,
<tt>L</tt>, and a right subtree, <tt>R</tt>.  
There are two techniques for deleting <tt>N</tt>:
the first is simple
but has a bad practical behavior:

<dl>
<dd>
Use <tt>L</tt> as if it is the new tree.  Because all the values in
<tt>L</tt> have keys that are less than all those in <tt>R</tt>,
we merely attach <tt>R</tt> where the rightmost Leaf rests in
<tt>L</tt>. 
</dl>
Here is a picture:
<pre>
          N                         L
        /   \                      / \
       L     R        ==>          ---R
      / \   / \                      / \
      ---.  ---                      ---
</pre>
The dot in the first drawing represents the rightmost leaf; this
leaf is replaced by tree <tt>R</tt> by resetting a link.
The resulting tree is ordered.

<p>
This alteration is easy to do, but it makes the ordered
tree highly unbalanced very quickly---searches into the
<tt>R</tt>-part are dramatically slowed.

<h4>Improved deletion algorithm</h4>
<p>
The second approach is more complex but actually helps to rebalance
the ordered tree.  We move an innermost node to the root.
Here is a picture first, which shows how innermost node, <tt>W</tt>,
becomes the new root:
<pre>
          N                          W
        /   \                      /   \
       L     R        ==>         L     R
      / \   / \                  / \   / \
      ---Z  ---                  ---Z  ---
        / \                        / \
       Y   W                      Y   X
      /\  / \                    /\  /\
         X   .
        /\
</pre>
The dot is a leaf; the letters denote nodes.
<tt>W</tt> is the rightmost node in subtree <tt>L</tt>;
since <tt>W</tt> is rightmost, its right subtree
<em>must be a leaf</em>.  We make <tt>W</tt> the new root and leave behind
<tt>W</tt>'s left subtree, <tt>X</tt>, attaching it to <tt>W</tt>'s former parent,
<tt>Z</tt>.  This makes the new tree ordered.

<p>
In the above situation, we could also choose
to move the <em>leftmost</em> node in subtree <tt>R</tt> to be the root;
this works equally well.

<p>
Here is an algorithm for making the innermost rightmost node of <tt>L</tt>
into the root:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>
Within <tt>L</tt>, locate its <em>rightmost</em>
node; say that it is <tt>W</tt>.
Say that <tt>W</tt>'s parent node is <tt>Z</tt>.
Make <tt>W</tt> the root of the new tree, by:
<li>
<tt>Z.setRight(W.left())</tt>, that is, parent <tt>Z</tt> links to
the subtree that <tt>W</tt> holds.  (This frees <tt>W</tt> to move to the
root; recall that <tt>W</tt> is the rightmost node in <tt>L</tt>, meaning
that <tt>W</tt>'s right subtree must be a Leaf.)
<li>
<tt>W.setLeft(L)</tt>
<li>
<tt>W.setRight(R)</tt>
<li>
Reset all parent links accordingly.
</ol>
</dl>

This technique naturally balances the tree over a period of deletions,
when the technique is alternated with its dual, which moves the leftmost
node from <tt>R</tt> to be the new root:
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>
Within <tt>R</tt>, locate its <em>leftmost</em> node; say that it is <tt>W</tt>.
Say that <tt>W</tt>'s parent node is <tt>Z</tt>.
Now, make <tt>W</tt> the root of the new tree, by:
<li>
<tt>Z.setLeft(W.right())</tt>, that is, parent <tt>Z</tt> links to
the subtree that <tt>W</tt> holds.  (This frees <tt>W</tt> to move to the
root; recall that <tt>W</tt> is the leftmost node in <tt>R</tt>, meaning
that <tt>W</tt>'s left subtree must be a Leaf.)
<li>
<tt>W.setRight(R)</tt>
<li>
<tt>W.setLeft(L)</tt>
<li>
Reset all parent links.
</ol>
</dl>
Again, by alternating the two deletion algorithms we rebalance the tree
over a series of deletions.

<p>
You can see the implementation of this form of deletion in
<tt>class OrderedTree</tt> in
<a href="MutableTreeEx/MutableOrderedTree.html">
<tt>package MutableOrderedTree</tt></a>.


<p>
Finally, there are more sophisticated methods for inserting and deleting
values in ordered trees.  So-called <em>AVL trees</em> rearrange
their subtrees after every insertion and after every deletion to ensure that
the tree is always almost balanced.   We will study AVL
trees later in the course.
