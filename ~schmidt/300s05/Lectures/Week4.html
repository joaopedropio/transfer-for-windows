<h2>Linked-List Implementation of Stacks</h2>

One disadvantage of using an array to implement a stack is the
wasted space---most of the time most of the array is unused.
A more elegant and economical implementation of a stack uses a
<em>linked list</em>, which is a data structure that links together
individual data objects as if they were ``links'' in a ``chain'' of data.

<p>
Here is a sketch of a linked-list-based ``stack'' that holds 1, then 5, and
then 20 at the bottom:
<pre>
          ---
top ---> | 1 |
         |---|      ---
         | o-|---> | 5 |
          ---      |---|      ----
                   | o-|---> | 20 |
                    ---      |----|
                             |null|
                              ----
</pre>
The list consists of three
``cells,'' each of which holds a data object and a ``link'' to another
cell.  A variable, <tt>top</tt>, holds the address of the first cell in the
list.  An empty stack looks like this:
<pre>
top ---> null
</pre>
(That is, variable <tt>top</tt> holds value, <tt>null</tt>.)
Each time an object is pushed, a cell is constructed, the object
is inserted into the cell, and the cell is linked to the front of the
chain of cells.  For example, pushing  <tt>20</tt> onto the empty stack
gives us
<pre>
          ----
top ---> | 20 |
	 |--- | 
	 |null|
          ----
</pre>
After 5 and then 1 are pushed, we obtain the picture first seen.

<p>
Say that we pop an object from the stack; the picture changes to this:
<pre>
                    ---
          top ---> | 5 |
	           |---|      ----
                   | o-|---> | 20 |
                    ---      |----|
	                     |null|
                              ----
</pre>

<h3>How to code Cells and Stacks</h3>

<p>
Figure 7 defines <tt>class Cell</tt>, which one uses to create the
cells in the list.
<pre>FIGURE 7: list cell======================================================

/** Cell models a cell of a linked list.  */
public class Cell
{ private Object val;  // value in the cell
  private Cell next;   // the address of the next cell in the list

  /** Constructor Cell builds a new cell 
    * @param value - the value inserted in the cell
    * @param link - the cell that is chained to this new cell */
  public Cell(Object value, Cell link)
  { val = value; 
    next = link;
  }

  /** getVal  returns the value held in the cell  */
  public Object getVal()
  { return val; }

  /** getNext  returns the address of the cell chained to this one */
  public Cell getNext()
  { return next; }

  /** setNext  resets the address of the cell chained to this one
    * @param link - the address of the Cell that is chained to this one */
  public void setNext(Cell link)
  { next = link; }
}

ENDFIGURE================================================================</pre>
<tt>class Cell</tt> is really just a container to hold the object,
<tt>val</tt>, and the linkage, <tt>next</tt>.

<p>
The three-celled linked list sketched above can be manually
constructed by this
sequence of initializations:
<pre>
Cell cell1 = new Cell(new Integer(20), null);
Cell cell2 = new Cell(new Integer(5), cell1);
Cell top = new Cell(new Integer(1), cell2);
</pre>
Since <tt>class Cell</tt> holds values of type <tt>Object</tt>,
we must ``wrap'' the integers into <tt>Integer</tt> objects before
placing them in cells.

<p>
The example list looks like a stack, and indeed, it is easy to
revise the coding of <tt>class Stack</tt> so that it is implemented with a linked list.
Figure 8 shows the new implementation of a stack.
<pre>FIGURE 8: stack implemented by a linked list============================

/** Stack implements a stack as a linked list */
public class Stack
{ private Cell top;  // marks the topmost Cell of the stack

  /** Constructor Stack creates an empty stack */
  public Stack()
  { top = null; }

  /** push  inserts a new element onto the stack
    * @param ob - the element to be added */
  public void push(Object ob)
  { top = new Cell(ob, top); }

 /** pop  removes the most recently added element
    * @return the element removed from the stack
    * @exception RuntimeException if stack is empty */
  public Object pop()
  { if ( top == null )
       { throw new RuntimeException("Stack error: stack empty"); }
    Object answer = top.getVal(); 
    top = top.getNext(); 
    return answer; 
  }

 /** top  returns the identity of the most recently added element
    * @return the element
    * @exception RuntimeException if stack is empty */
  public Object top()
  { if ( top == null )
       { throw new RuntimeException("Stack error: stack empty"); }
    return top.getVal();
  }

  /** isEmpty  states whether the stack has 0 elements.
    * @return whether the stack has no elements  */
  public boolean isEmpty()
  { return (top == null); }
}

ENDFIGURE==============================================================</pre>

<p>
Here is an important point: <em>In terms of the perspective of the user
of the stack</em>, the coding in Figure 7 looks the same
and computes the same behaviors as the earlier version of
<tt>class Stack</tt> --- we have changed the internal <em>implementation</em>
of <tt>class Stack</tt> but maintained the same <em>behavior</em>.
(In this sense, the coding in Figure 7 is an equivalement replacement part
for any program that requires a stack.)

<p>
The linked list implementation has a simpler internal state and
simpler codings of its methods than the stack whose implementation
is based on an array.  Here is
a picture of the storage configuration when a stack named
<tt>operands</tt> was used to push 20 then 5 then 1:
<pre>
                  ----
Stack operands ==| a1 |
                  ----
 a1 : Stack
 -------------------
 | Cell top ==| a15 |
 |             ----- 
 |  ...

  a11 : Cell                a13 : Cell                a15: Cell
 ------------              ------------               ------------
 | Object val ==| a10 |    | Object val ==| a12 |    | Object val ==| a14 |
 |               -----     |               -----     |               -----
 | Cell next ==| null |    | Cell next ==| a11 |     | Cell next ==| a13 | 
 |              ------     |              -----      |              -----
 |  ...                    |  ...                    | ...

  a10 : Integer         a12 : Integer           a14 : Integer
 ---------------      --------------        --------------
 | (holds 20)         | (holds 5)           | (holds 1)
</pre>
Say that <tt>operands.pop()</tt> is used twice, removing two values from
the stack, and <tt>operands.push(new Integer(4))</tt> is used next.
The storage configuration changes to this:
<pre>
                  ----
Stack operands ==| a1 |
                  ----
 a1 : Stack
 -------------------
 | Cell top ==| a17 |
 |             ----- 
 |  ...

  a11 : Cell                a13 : Cell                a15: Cell
 ------------              ------------               ------------
 | Object val ==| a10 |    | Object val ==| a12 |    | Object val ==| a14 |
 |               -----     |               -----     |               -----
 | Cell next ==| null |    | Cell next ==| a11 |     | Cell next ==| a13 |
 |              ------     |              -----      |              -----
 |  ...                    |  ...                    | ...

  a17 : Cell                         a16 : Integer
 ------------                       ---------------
 | Object val ==| a16 |             | (holds 4)
 |               ----- 
 | Cell next ==| a11 |
 |              ------
 |  ...

  a10 : Integer         a12 : Integer           a14 : Integer
 ---------------      --------------        --------------
 | (holds 20)         | (holds 5)           | (holds 1)
</pre>
The cells at addresses <tt>a13</tt> and <tt>a15</tt> are no longer
used by the stack.  What happens to them?   Do they remain in computer
storage, unused, forever?   The answer is ``no''--- Embedded within
the Java Virtual Machine is an extra
program, called a <em>garbage collector</em>, that periodically examines
computer storage
and destroys all objects that are not used by the executing Java program.   

<p>
(<em>BeginFootnote:</em> An object, <tt>ob</tt>,  is ``used'' in the sense that,
starting from an application's <tt>main</tt>
method, we can find an address of an object,
and that object holds an address of another object, and so on, until
an object is reached that holds the address of <tt>ob</tt>.
<em>EndFootnote</em>)

<p>
Thanks to the garbage collector program, we need not make special
efforts to destroy the cell that is unneeded after an invocation of
<tt>pop</tt>; the cell will disappear automatically. 
Also, the garbage collection will dispose of those <tt>Integer</tt>
objects that are no longer used by the application.

<p>
The importance of the garbage collector to programming style cannot
be overstated---it lets a programmer use objects as freely as
numbers, creating them at will, using them with methods
as arguments and results,
and not worrying about their fate when they are ``used up.''
