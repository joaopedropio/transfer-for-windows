<h2>Software development in Java: interfaces and graphics</h2>

When a program must have a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
it is serious work to construct the program's view component
and to connect the controller to the view.

<p>
To help,
the Java packages, <tt>javax.swing</tt> and
<tt>java.awt</tt>, provide classes that you use for constructing
windows, buttons, text fields, and so on.
These classes come ``unconnected'' and you must connect the classes
in a standard way to generate GUI's that look and operate properly.  
<!--
A Java <em>interface</em> is used to state how a class expects to
connect (send messages to) another, unknown class.
To learn about interfaces, we study an example.
-->

<p>
We review GUI construction via an example.

<p>
Say that a user wants a program that computes square roots and wants
the input/output processed with a GUI.
Here is a sample use-case:
The GUI
asks its user to type a number, and when the number is typed and
the Compute button is pressed, the program computes the number's square
root
and presents the answer:
<pre>
<img src="GraphicsExample/sqrt1.gif">  <img src="GraphicsExample/sqrt2.gif">
</pre>

<p>
We must write a program with this behavior.  The program's
component structure fits the
model-view-controller pattern, where the model holds the number
upon which we compute the square root. The controller's 
algorithm is simple:

<p>
When the Compute button is pressed,
<ol>
<li>
read the number from the GUI's text field;
<li>
tell the model to compute the number's square root
<li>
tell the GUI to print it
</ol>

<p>
Here is a picture of the application's component structure:
<pre>
<img src="VoteExample/Figs/design3.jpg">
</pre>
Notice that the algorithm starts <em>when the user presses the
Compute button.</em>  This means the controller is somehow connected
to the Compute button in the GUI.

<p>
To build the GUI, we
use <tt>javax.swing</tt>'s
prebuilt classes,
<tt>JFrame</tt>, <tt>JButton</tt>, and
<tt>JTextField</tt> (this is where the input is typed),
and <tt>JLabel</tt> (this displays the answer).


<!--
<h4>About <tt>javax.swing</tt></h4>


Classes
<tt>JFrame</tt>, <tt>JButton</tt>, and
<tt>JTextField</tt>, and others are used
to construct the input-output view.
The
classes are found in the package, <tt>javax.swing</tt>.
-->

(Of course, <em>we need not read the coding inside these classes;
we assume the classes are properly written and we construct objects
from them.</em>)  

<p>
We import the components in the package with the
statement,
<pre>
import javax.swing.*;
</pre>

<p>
This style of programming --- relying on components that we do not
ourselves write --- is crucial to modern-day programming.
To connect the components from <tt>javax.swing</tt> to the ones
we will write, we must use
an important concept, called an <em>interface</em>.

<p>
So, we must take a small diversion
from the design of the example to learn a bit about
Java interfaces.

<p>
(If you wish to preview the results of the exercise, you can find
the package that contains this example and the API at
<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/GraphicsExample">
<tt>http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/GraphicsExample</tt></a>.
)


<h3>Java Interfaces</h3>

<p>
<!--
To import a package like <tt>javax,swing</tt>,
we must have the package already written and
available to our computer. 
Often a big application is
divided into several packages, which connect together, and the
packages must be written in parallel.  (For example, the
people who wrote <tt>javax.swing</tt> did so without knowing
about our square-root program.)  How is this done?
-->

<p>
A Java <tt>interface</tt> is a powerful tool for connecting together
a package we write to a package other people write.
Here is a small story to introduce how to use interfaces:

<p>
Say we write a <tt>package P</tt>, which contains
<tt>class C</tt>, and <tt>class C</tt> needs to use some methods,
<tt>m1</tt> and <tt>m2</tt>, that we will not write ---
Someone else will write them and place them into another class.

<p>
So, we pretend that the 
missing methods belong to a class named <tt>Helper</tt>:
<pre>
package P;
/** class C  needs the help of two methods,  m1  and  m2.  They are missing,
  *  and we assume that their codings will be supplied in a  Helper  object. */
public class C
{ private Helper helpme;  // Helper is the name we use for the missing component

  public C(Helper h)      // When someone constructs a new C-object,
                          // the address of a ``Helper'' object is supplied.
  {  ...  helpme = h; ... }


   ... helpme.m1() ... helpme.m2() ...   // Invoke the missing methods.
                      
}
</pre>
But what is <tt>Helper</tt>?   It is not a class ---it is the
name of a java <tt>interface</tt>,
and we must write this code also, which goes with <tt>class C</tt>:
<pre>
package P;
/**  interface Helper lists the missing methods */
public interface Helper
{ public void m1();   // There is only a header line, no coding!
  public void m2();   // Note the semicolons at the end of the header lines.
}
</pre>
<tt>class C</tt> assumes that some
``helper'' class, of type <tt>Helper</tt>, will contain the codings of the
needed methods, <tt>m1</tt> and <tt>m2</tt>.  
<tt>Interface Helper</tt> lists the names of the methods.

<p>
Next,
<em>when the methods are written, they are placed in a class that
``implements'' the interface:</em>

<pre>
package Q;
import P.*;  // import  interface Helper
public class Worker implements Helper   // the last two words assert
       // that this class can be used as a ``Helper''
{ ...
  public void m1()
  { ... code for  m1  goes here ... }

  public void m2()
  { ... code for  m2  goes here ... }

  ... other methods may go here ...
}
</pre>
The example shows us that the codings of <tt>m1</tt> and <tt>m2</tt>
are exactly what are intended for others to use; this is indicated
by the crucial phrase, <tt>implements Helper</tt>, in the class's
header line.  The phrase indicates that <tt>class Worker</tt> can
be used wherever a <tt>Helper</tt> is needed.

<p>
Because they agree on the same interface,
<em>the two components may be ``connected'':</em>
This can be done with
a ``start-up'' class that makes the 
connection.  The start-up class for the example might look like this:
<pre>
import P.*; 
import Q.*;
/** We use the  main  method to construct and connect together the
  *  objects of the program.  */
public class Start
{ public static void main(String[] a) 
  { ...
    Worker w = new Worker();
    C x = new C(w);  // ``connect''  w  to  x
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
The start-up class constructs a <tt>Worker</tt>, <tt>w</tt>,
which implements the
<tt>Helper</tt> interface.  Then, the start-up class
``connects'' the <tt>w</tt> to the <tt>C</tt>-object, <tt>x</tt>,
that requires a <tt>Helper</tt>.  The connection is done by
parameter passing --- it works! 
Parameter passing is a standard way of connecting together objects.

<p>
In summary:
<dl>
<dd>
<em>
A Java interface defines a ``connection point'' that allows one class
to connect to another.  But the classes that connect can
be written and
compiled separately, at different times and places, within different
packages, on different computers.  The classes are connected by
parameter passing in
a ``start-up'' class.
</em>
</dl>



<h3>The GUI for the Square Root Program</h3>

<p>
With the background on Java interfaces, we can understand better
how we connect the classes in the <tt>javax.swing</tt> package
to the square-root application that we are designing:

<p>
Classes <tt>JFrame</tt>, <tt>JButton</tt>, etc., of
<tt>javax.swing</tt> are already written, and 
they use a standardized connection, named
<tt>interface ActionListener</tt>.
The square-root program we write will connect its controller to the GUI
via <tt>interface ActionListener</tt>.

<p>
Here are a few technical details:

<ol>
<li>
When the user presses the mouse button, the computer hardware
signals the operating
system's mouse interrupt hander.  The interrupt handler
determines that the mouse
press was done on top of the Computer button ``owned'' by the square-root
program.  
<li>
So, the OS starts
a method in the
<tt>JButton</tt>'s code, which in turn starts
the controller that is connected to
<tt>interface ActionListener</tt>.
</ol>

<p>
To understand Step 2, let's examine
the crucial program pieces.  First, the connection point is
defined by <tt>interface ActionListener</tt>:
<pre>
package javax.swing;
public interface ActionListener
{ public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e); }
</pre>
It says that the controller connects to the <tt>JButton</tt>
by <tt>implementing ActionListener</tt>.     This means the
controller's algorithm <em>must</em> be coded in a method named
<tt>actionPerformed</tt>.

<p>
The controller that we write must look like this:
<pre>
package SquareRoot;
import javax.swing.*;
public class Controller implements ActionListener
{ ...

  /** actionPerformed holds the algorithm, which executes when the
    *  Compute button is pressed.  */
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)
  { ... read integer
    ... compute square root
    ... display result
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The final component in the puzzle is <tt>class JButton</tt>,
which is pre-written and found in package
<tt>javax.swing</tt>:
<pre>
package javax.swing;
public class JButton
{
  private ActionListener handler;  // Remembers the object that will
                           // be contacted when this button is pressed
   ...

  /** This method connects the  handler  object to the button:  */
  public void addActionListener(ActionListener x)
  { handler = x; } 

   ...

  // later in the coding of JButton, this instruction is started by the OS/JVM
  //  when there is a mouse click:
    ...  handler.actionPerformed(...); ...
}
</pre>

<p>
This
class diagram for the square root program
shows us how the
components connect together:
<pre>
<img src="GraphicsExample/diagram1.jpg">
</pre>
There are two packages, <tt>SquareRoot</tt> and <tt>javax.swing</tt>.
The view is constructed from <tt>SquareRootFrame</tt>, a class we write
that <tt>extends JFrame</tt>.
The frame uses <tt>JButton</tt> and <tt>JTextField</tt>.
The model component is a single method that knows how to compute
a square root.  The controller holds its algorithm inside
method <tt>actionPerformed</tt>.

<p>
As described above, when the user presses the Compute button, this
executes a part of <tt>JButton</tt>,
that invokes a method named <tt>actionPerformed</tt>.
Because <tt>Controller</tt> is connected to <tt>JButton</tt>,
via the <tt>ActionListener</tt> interface, the <tt>actionPerformed</tt>
method in the <tt>Controller</tt> is executed.

<p>
The various lines and arrow heads in the diagram are written in the style of
the UML modelling language.  Here are their meanings:
<ul>
<li>
A solid arrow with a large, white arrow head means that one class
<tt>extends</tt> another---this is called <em>inheritance</em>.
Here, <tt>class SquareRootFrame extends JFrame</tt>.
<li>
A dashed arrow means that a component connects to (uses) an interface.
Here, the prebuilt <tt>java.awt.event</tt> object
uses the <tt>ActionListener</tt> interface
to send <tt>actionPerformed</tt> messages to whatever objects
``connect to the other side'' of the interface.  (More precisely,
to whatever object <tt>implements</tt> the interface.)
<li>
A dashed arrow with a large, white arrow head means that a class
<em>implements</em> an interface, that is, the class has methods
written for each of the method names listed in the interface.
Here,
<pre>
class Controller implements ActionListener
</pre>
So, a <tt>Controller</tt> object is capable of receiving the
<tt>actionPerformed</tt> messages.
</ul>

<p>
The diagram shows that <tt>Controller</tt> and <tt>SquareRootFrame</tt>
``connect'' across package boundaries.
If a component in one package wishes to use components in another package,
then it must have a Java <tt>import</tt> statement.  For example,
the coding of <tt>class SquareRootFrame</tt> looks like this:
<pre>
package SquareRoot;
import javax.swing.*;
 ...
public class SquareRootFrame extends JFrame
{ ...
   private JTextField input_text = new JTextField(...); 
  ...
}
</pre>
The <tt>import</tt> statement makes the classes in
package <tt>javax.swing</tt> usable
within <tt>class SquareRootFrame</tt>.
(Recall that <tt>extends JFrame</tt> means that <tt>SquareRootFrame</tt>
absorbs the code in <tt>class JFrame</tt> and appends its own code,
thus generating a
customized variant of frame.  Of course,
the declaration of <tt>input_text</tt> defines a private variable
that holds the address of a <tt>JTextField</tt> object, which is
used in the customized frame.)

<h3>Coding the program</h3>

Now we are ready to write classes <tt>SquareRootComputer</tt>,
<tt>Controller</tt>, and <tt>SquareRootFrame</tt>.
We also write <tt>class Start</tt>, whose <tt>main</tt> method
connects everything together.

<h4>Model</h4>

The purpose of the model is to compute a square root:
<pre>
package SquareRoot;
/** SquareRootComputer computes square roots  */
public class SquareRootComputer
{  // there really is no need to construct a variable cell to hold
   //  the number that we square-root, so we won't.

   public SquareRootComputer() { }

  /** computeSquareRoot  computes a square root
    * @param i - the number
    * @return  i's square root  */
  public double computeSquareRoot(double i)
  { double answer = 0;
    if ( i < 0 )
         { throw new RuntimeException("negative number: " + i); }
    else { answer = Math.sqrt(i); }
    return answer; }
}
</pre>

<h4>Controller</h4>

The controller's algorithm is embedded in the <tt>actionPerformed</tt>
method; notice also how the controller's constructor method
remembers the addresses of the view and model objects and tells
the view to connect the controller to the Compute button.
(Please see the coding of method <tt>connectControllerToButton</tt>
in <tt>class SquareRootFrame</tt>, which follows.)
<pre>
package SquareRoot;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
/** Controller implements a button that computes square roots */
public class Controller implements ActionListener
{ private SquareRootComputer calc;  // model object
  private SquareRootFrame view;  // view object

  /** Constructor Controller constructs the button
    * @param v - the address of the view object 
    * @param c - the address of the model object 
  public Controller(SquareRootFrame v, SquareRootComputer c)
  { view = v;
    calc = c; 
    // tell the view to connect its Compute button to this controller:
    view.connectControllerToButton(this);
  }

  /** actionPerformed computes and displays a square root.
    *  The method is called when the view's Computer button is pressed */
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)
  { String answer = "";
    try { String s = view.getInput().trim(); 
          double number = new Double(s).doubleValue();
          double root = calc.computeSquareRoot(number);
          answer = "The square root of " + number + " is " + root;
        }
    catch(RuntimeException e)   // if  s  is erroneous, an exception occurs
        { answer = "Bad input error:" + e.getMessage(); }  
    view.setOutput(answer);
  }
}
</pre>

<h4>View</h4>

The view must assemble the GUI from a frame, a text field,
a button, and a label:
<pre>
package SquareRoot;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;
/** SquareRootFrame shows the input and output for square-root computation*/
public class SquareRootFrame extends JFrame
{ private String BLANKS = "     ";

  // input is typed into this field:
  private JTextField input_text = new JTextField(BLANKS, 6); 
  // the answer is displayed by this label:
  private JLabel answer = new JLabel(BLANKS); 
  // this is the button that triggers square-root computation:
  private JButton compute_button = new JButton("Compute");

  /** SquareRootFrame assembles and displays the frame  */
  public SquareRootFrame()
  { // here are the usual, painful steps for placing graphical
    //  components into a JFrame:
    Container cp = getContentPane();
    cp.setLayout(new GridLayout(4, 1));
      JPanel p1 = new JPanel(new FlowLayout());
      p1.add(new JLabel("Type a number:"));
    cp.add(p1);
      JPanel p2  = new JPanel(new FlowLayout());
      p2.add(input_text);
    cp.add(p2);
      JPanel p3 = new JPanel(new FlowLayout());
      p3.add(answer);
    cp.add(p3);
      JPanel p4 = new JPanel(new FlowLayout());
      p4.add(compute_button);
    cp.add(p4);
    setSize(350, 160);
    setTitle("Square Root Convertor");
    setVisible(true);
  }

  /** getInput returns the input the user typed into the text field
    * @return the string typed in the text field  */
  public String getInput()
  { return input_text.getText(); }

  /** setOutput displays a new answer and clears the input text field.
    * @param s - the new answer displayed  */
  public void setOutput(String s)
  { answer.setText(s);
    input_text.setText(BLANKS);
  }

  /** connectControllerToButton  connects the controller object to
    *  the Compute button
    * @param con - the controller object */
 public void connectControllerToButton(Controller con)
 { compute_button.addActionListener(con); }  // addActionListener is a
      // method in JButton that connects the button press to the object
      // that responds to the button press
}
</pre>
The three methods included in the view are invoked by the controller
to read the input number, to display the answer, and to connect
the controller to the button that triggers the computation.

<h4>Start-up</h4>

The application is started by the command,
<tt>java SquareRoot.Start</tt>.  The <tt>main</tt> method in
<tt>Start</tt> assembles the application from its components:
<pre>
package SquareRoot;
/** Start starts the square-root calculator application. */
public class Start
{ public static void main(String[] args)
  { SquareRootComputer model = new SquareRootComputer();
    SquareRootFrame view = new SquareRootFrame();
    Controller con = new Controller(view,model);
  }
}
</pre>

The completed square-root computer, called <tt>package SquareRoot</tt>,
can be downloaded at
<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/GraphicsExample">
<tt>http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/GraphicsExample</tt></a>.

<!--
<h4>Using a Java interface to handle a button press</h4>

<ol>
<li>
The instructions that must be executed when the square-root
application's button is pushed
are
contained within class <tt>ComputeButton</tt>.
<li>
But when
the user clicks the mouse above the graphical button,
the signal goes to <tt>JButton</tt> instead!
</ol>
How does the coding within <tt>class JButton</tt> know that it
should invoke the instructions in <tt>class ComputeButton</tt>?
Well, it doesn't---<em>the person who wrote <tt>class JButton</tt>
did not know how the graphical button might be used in future
applications</em>.   Therefore, some form of ``connection point'' or
``plug-in point'' is needed so that future users of
<tt>class JButton</tt> could ``plug into'' the mouse clicks and
trigger computation.  This connection point is called a
<em>Java interface</em>.

<p>
It is no accident that <tt>class ComputeButton</tt> uses a method
named <tt>actionPerformed</tt> to hold the instructions that must be executed
due to a mouse click on the button---<tt>class JButton</tt> is written
<em>so that it invokes the <tt>actionPerformed</tt> method:</em>
<pre>
package javax.swing;
public class JButton
{ // this field remembers the address of the object that will
  //  do computation when the button is clicked by the mouse:
  private ActionListener handler;  

   ...

  public void addActionListener(ActionListener x)
  { handler = x; }

   ...

  // there is also another method that contains code that reacts
  // to a mouse click.  The crucial statement reads:
  handler.actionPerformed(...);
}
</pre>
That is, a private variable, <tt>handler</tt>, remembers the object
that contains the code that must be triggered when the button is
clicked.  The trigger is done by the statement,
<tt>handler.actionPerformed(...)</tt>.
The method, <tt>addActionListener</tt>, lets us set variable
<tt>handler</tt> correctly.

<p>
Now, let's review what <tt>class ComputeButton</tt> looks like:
<pre>
package SquareRoot;
import javax.swing.*;
  ...
public class ComputeButton extends JButton implements ActionListener
{ ...
  /** Constructor ComputeButton constructs the button
    * @param v - the address of the view object */
  public ComputeButton(SquareRootFrame v)
  {  ...
    //  tells class JButton to register this object, the ComputeButton,
    //  to handle mouse clicks:
    addActionListener(this);
  }

  /** actionPerformed computes and displays a square root  */
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt)
  { ... here are the instructions that are executed when the
        button is pressed ...
  }
}
</pre>
The key points are:
<ol>
<li>
<tt>ComputeButton extends JButton</tt>---this means that 
<tt>ComputeButton</tt> is itself a customized version of <tt>JButton</tt>.
<li>
<tt>addActionListener(this)</tt>---in <tt>ComputeButton</tt>'s
constructor method, we tell the underlying <tt>JButton</tt> to
use <em>this very object---the <tt>ComputeButton</tt></em> as the
object to contact when there is a mouse click on the button.
<li>
<tt>public void actionPerformed</tt>---the method holds the instructions
that will be executed when the button is clicked.
</ol>
In summary:
<ul>
<li>
The <tt>addActionListener</tt> method in <tt>JButton</tt>
tells a button which object to contact when there is a mouse click.
<li>
The <tt>actionPerformed</tt> method holds the instructions that
are executed when the mouse is clicked.
</ul>

<p>
But there is one last technical loose end:  What is
<tt>ActionListener</tt>?   It is mentioned in two places:
<ol>
<li>
Within the field declaration of <tt>JButton</tt>:
<pre>
private ActionListener handler;
</pre>
<li>
In the header line of <tt>ComputeButton</tt>:
<pre>
public class ComputeButton extends JButton implements ActionListener
</pre>
</ol>
Clearly, the name <tt>ActionListener</tt> is used as a ``stand-in'' 
for the type of the object held by the private field,
<tt>handler</tt> in <tt>JButton</tt>.  This is crucial because the
author of <tt>class JButton</tt> did not know about <tt>class ComputeButton</tt>,
so a ``stand-in class name'' must be used instead.

<p>
Such a stand-in name is known as a <em>Java interface</em>.

<p>
If we dig within <tt>package javax.swing</tt>, we will locate this
file, named <tt>ActionListener.java</tt>.  It is the official description
of the stand-in name:
<pre>
package javax.swing;
public interface ActionListener
{ public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e); }
</pre>
Note that the stand-in name
<em>and all the methods associated
with it</em> are listed in the file.

<p>
Now we can understand why the header line of <tt>class ComputeButton</tt>
contains the phrase,  <tt>implements ActionListener</tt>---this tells
the Java compiler that <tt>ComputeButton</tt> contains an
<tt>actionPerformed</tt> method and can be used anywhere where
an <tt>ActionListener</tt> object is required
(e.g., in <tt>JButton</tt>!).

<p>
The preceding is a practical explanation of Java interfaces---<em>a
Java interface lets one class refer to another class that is
not yet written.</em>
But there is a more important, philosophical viewpoint:
A Java interface is a description (or specification) of a
``connection'' or ``plug-in'' point, where one class
(the one that <tt>implements</tt> the interface) connects to
another class that uses/invokes the methods that are listed in
the interface file.
-->

<h3>Interfaces Are Connection Points</h3>

The square-root program showed how we can write a class,
<tt>Controller</tt>, that connects with a
prewritten object so that it receives button presses --- we
<em>implement</em> the predefined interface, <tt>ActionListener</tt>.

<p>
Looking from the other side, the writers of the <tt>java.awt.event</tt>
package were able to write <tt>class JButton</tt>,
which receives button presses,
even though the writers did not know which class would eventually handle
the button presses---they made <tt>JButton</tt> send <tt>actionPerformed</tt>
messages to whatever object connects to the
<tt>ActionListener</tt> interface.

<p>
The two components (<tt>JButton</tt> and the controller)
that connect to <tt>interface ActionListener</tt>
are separate, and one can be unplugged and replaced by another without
causing harm.  Interfaces are a powerful tool for building program
subassemblies that can connect to other, unknown assemblies.

<p>
The preceding is a practical explanation of Java interfaces---<em>a
Java interface lets one class refer to another class that is
not yet written.</em>
But there is a more important, philosophical viewpoint:
A Java interface is a description (or specification) of a
``connection'' or ``plug-in'' point, where one class
(the one that <tt>implements</tt> the interface) connects to
another class that uses/invokes the methods that are listed in
the interface file.

<p>
In a later lecture, we learn to write our own interfaces.
