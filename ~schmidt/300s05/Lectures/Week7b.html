<h2>Tree data structures</h2>

A <em>tree</em> data structure is a powerful tool for organizing
data objects based on keys.  It is equally useful for organizing
multiple data objects in terms of hierarchical relationships (think
of a ``family tree'', where the children are grouped under their
parents in the tree).

<p>
Trees are usually drawn pictorially like this (again, think of a
``family tree''), where data can be placed where the asterisks appear:
<pre>
                          *
                        /  \
                       *    *
                      / \  /|\
                     *   ** * *
                        /\  ...
                       ...
</pre>
The asterisks represent <em>node</em>s; the node at
the top is the <em>root</em>, the tree's ``starting point.''
The arcs between nodes are called <em>branches</em>.
A node that has no branches underneath it is called a <em>leaf</em>.
Real trees grow from their root upwards to the sky, but computer-science
trees grow from the root downwards.

<p>
Here is an example of a tree of species, from zoology:
<pre>
<img src="GrammarNotes/species.jpg">
</pre>

<p>
When we examine a non-leaf node, we see that the node has trees growing
underneath it, and we say that the node <em>has children subtrees</em>.
For example, the root node, ``Animal'', has two children subtrees.

<p>
Tree structures make an excellent alternative to arrays,
especially when the data stored within them is keyed or has internal
structure that allows one element to be related to, or ``saved within''
another.

<h3>Applications of Trees</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Trees can hold objects that are sorted by their keys.
The nodes are ordered so that all keys in a node's left subtree
are less than the key of the object at the node, and all 
keys in a node's right subtree are greater than
the key of the object at the node.
Here is an example of a tree of records, where each record
is stored with its integer key in a tree node:
<pre>
<img src="GrammarNotes/orderedtree.jpg">
</pre>
Here, the leaves are used as ``end points'' and hold nothing.

<p>
We call such a tree an <em>ordered tree</em> or a <em>search tree</em>.
The tree drawn above is ordered on the integer keys saved in the nodes.

<p>
The advantages of ordered trees over sorted arrays are:
<ul>
<li>
both insertions (and retrievals) of objects by key take on the average
log<sub>2</sub>N time, where N is the number of objects stored.
<li>
the tree naturally grows to hold an arbitrary, unlimited number of
objects.
</ul>

<li>
Trees can hold objects that are located by keys that are sequences.
For example, we might have some books with these Library of Congress
catalog numbers:
<pre>
QA76  book1
QA7   book2
Q17   book3
B1    book4
Z4    book5
</pre>
The books's keys are sequences, and the sequences label the branches
of a tree that holds the books:
<pre>
           *
           |
   +-------+----------+
 B |     Q |        Z |
   *       *          *
 1 |    1 /  \ A    4 |
 book4   *    *     book5
       7 |    | 7
      book3  book2
              | 6
             book1
</pre>
Books can be stored at nodes or leaves, and not all nodes hold a book
(e.g., <tt>Q1</tt>).
This tree is called a <em>spelling tree</em>, and it has the advantage
that the insertion and retrieval time of an object is related only
to the length of the key.

<li>
A tree can represent a structured object, such as a house that must be
explored by a robot or a human player in an adventure game:
<pre>
house's entrance----upper hallway----bedroom---closet---...
 |                  |          |
 |                  |          +-----private bath---...
 |                  +---study---...
 |
 lower hallway---kitchen---...
            |
            +---lounge---...
</pre>
We might imagine a robot entering the house at its entrance, knowing
nothing about what lies inside.  The robot's data base looks like this:
<pre>
house's entrance
</pre>
Perhaps the robot explores the upper hallway, bedroom, and private bath.
Its data base expands with the knowledge learned during the exploration:
<pre>
house's entrance----upper hallway----bedroom---closet---...
                               |
                               +-----private bath---...
</pre>
As the robot explores more and more of the house, its database, a tree,
grows to include the knowledge.  A tree structure is useful for
holding the knowledge, because trees can grow dynamically, spawning
branches and subtrees as needed.

<p>
A tree like the one above is sometimes called a <em>search tree</em>.
Indeed, the search trees seen in the earlier lectures on stacks and
queues also fit into this category.

<li>
Trees are used to represent phrase structure of sentences, which is
crucial to language processing programs.  Here is the phrase-structure
tree (``parse treee'') for the Java statements
<pre>
int x;
x = 3 + y;

</pre>
<pre>
              STATEMENT SEQUENCE
             /                  \
  DECLARATION              ASSIGNMENT
   /       \                /      \
TYPE  VARIABLE         VARIABLE    EXPRESSION
 |       |                |       /     |   \
int      x                x     NUMERAL + VARIABLE
                                 |          |
                                 3          y
</pre>
The Java compiler checks the grammatical structure of a Java program
by reading the program's words and attempting to build the program's
parse tree.  If successfully contructed, the parse tree is used as a guide
to help the Java compiler generate the byte code that one finds in the
program's  .class  file.  
<li>
An operating system maintains a disk's file system as a tree,
where file folders act as tree nodes:
<pre>
<img src="OSNotes/tree.jpg">
</pre>
The tree structure is useful because it easily accommodates the creation
and deletion of folders and files.
</ol>

The tree forms listed above have varying
internal structure,
but all are variations on the same basic idea --- an inductive
definition, which we now study in its purest form.

<h2>Binary Trees</h2>

<p>
We begin study with a form of tree whose nodes 
have exactly two subtrees.  Here is the inductive
definition:
<dl>
<dd>
<em>
A BinaryTree object is
<ol>
<li>
A Leaf-structure, representing an empty tree;
or
<li>
A Node-structure, which contains:
<ul>
<li>
an object, called the ``value''
<li>
a BinaryTree object, called the ``left subtree'';
<li>
a BinaryTree object, called the ``right subtree'';
</ul>
</ol>
</dl>
</em>
Here is a picture of a binary tree, where integers are saved
as values at the nodes, and leaves hold no integers at all:
<pre>
<img src="GrammarNotes/inttree.jpg">
<!--
           +---- Node: 9 -- - +
          /                  \
    left /                    \ right
       Node: 5                 Node: 12
 left /       \ right    left /       \ right
    Leaf     Leaf           Leaf    Node: 15
                                   /        \ right
                             left /          \
                                 Leaf       Leaf
-->
</pre>
Sometimes, the arcs that enamate from the nodes are labelled
so that we can describe subtrees; here, each node possess a
<em>left</em> subtree and a <em>right</em> subtre..

<p>
Since trees are inductively defined, the above tree can be drawn
as a layered structure:
<pre>
  Node----------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                           9                                       |
  |     Node--------------+       Node------------------------------+ |
  |     |         5       |       |         12                      | |
  |     |    Leaf   Leaf  |       |    Leaf    Node---------------+ | |
  |     +-----------------+       |            |         15       | | |
  |                               |            |    Leaf    Leaf  | | |
  |                               |            +------------------+ | |
  |                               +---------------------------------+ |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre>
Another representation of the above tree is
<pre>
Node( 9,  Node( 5, Leaf(), Leaf() )
          Node( 12, Leaf(),
                    Node( 15, Leaf(), Leaf() )
              )
    )
</pre>
This looks more like Java code, and it shows the nested structure of the
tree.

<h4>Processing a binary tree by recursion</h4>

<p>
There is a basic pattern for computing on binary trees; the pattern
follows the inductive definition.  Here is what it looks like in
equational form:
<pre>
process( Leaf ) = ...some simple answer...
process( Node(val, left, right) ) = ...compute an answer from  val,  process(left), and process(right)...
</pre>

Here is an example, which counts the number of Node-objects within a
binary tree:
<pre>
countNodes( Leaf ) = 0
countNodes( Node(val, left, right) ) =  1 + countNodes(left) + countNodes(right)
</pre>
The intuition behind the schema is simple: To count all the nodes in
a big tree, we split the task into pieces:  
<ol>
<li>
count all the nodes in the slightly smaller, left subtree;
<li>
count all the nodes in the slightly smaller, right subtree;
<li>
add together these counts, plus one, for the root.
</ol>
Here is a picture of the <tt>countNodes</tt> schema:
<pre>
<img src="GrammarNotes/countNodes.jpg">
</pre>
You should apply the schema to the above example tree and calculate
that it has four nodes.


<h3>The classes for binary trees</h3>

Here is the coding of the binary-tree data structure, based on the
inductive definition seen earlier.  First, we use an abstract class
to name the data type of binary tree:
<pre>
package BinTree;
/** BinaryTree defines the data type of binary trees: 
  *  (i) a leaf, or  
  *  (ii) a node that holds a value, a left subtree, and a right subtree. 
  * Methods listed below should be overridden as needed by subclasses. */
public abstract class BinaryTree
{ /** value returns the value held within a tree node
    * @return the value  */ 
  public Object value()
  { throw new RuntimeException("BinaryTree error: no value"); }

  /** left  returns the left subtree of this tree
    * @return the left subtree  */
  public BinaryTree left()
  { throw new RuntimeException("BinaryTree error: no left subtree"); }

  /** right  returns the right subtree of this tree
    * @return the right subtree  */
  public BinaryTree right()
  { throw new RuntimeException("BinaryTree error: no right subtree"); }
}
</pre>
First, here is the coding for leaf objects:
<pre>
package BinTree;
/** Leaf models a tree leaf---an empty tree  */
public class Leaf extends BinaryTree
{ /** Constructor Leaf constructs the empty tree */
  public Leaf() { }
}
</pre>
Next, we write the coding for constructing node objects:
<pre>
package BinTree;
/** Node models a nonempty tree node, holding a value and two subtrees  */
public class Node extends BinaryTree
{ private Object val;
  private BinaryTree left;
  private BinaryTree right;

  /** Constructor Node constructs the tree node
    * @param v - the value held in the node
    * @param l - the left subtree
    * @param r - the right subtree  */
  public Node(Object v, BinaryTree l, BinaryTree r)
  { val = v;
    left = l;
    right = r;
  }

  public Object value()
  { return val; }

  public BinaryTree left()
  { return left; }

  public BinaryTree right()
  { return right; }

}
</pre>
Notice that we have <em>not</em>
supplied methods to modify a tree structure
after the tree is first constructed.  Surprisingly, these are not crucial ---
we can always build new trees from scratch, as we will see.  (These issues
are addressed a bit later in this lecture.)

<p>
Here is the Java coding of the <tt>countNodes</tt> function, which
was developed in the previous subsection:
<pre>
  /** countNodes returns the number of Node-objects within a tree
    * @param t - the tree analyzed
    * @return the number of Nodes within  t  */
  public int countNodes(BinaryTree t)
  { int answer;
    if ( t instanceof Leaf )
         { answer = 0; }
    else // t must be a Node:
         { int left_answer = countNodes(t.left());
           int right_answer = countNodes(t.right());
           answer = 1 + left_answer + right_answer;
         }
    return answer;
  }
</pre>
<p>
You can find the classes for building binary trees here:
<h4>
<a href="BinTreeEx.html">Definition of BinaryTree data type and applications
that use it </a>
</h4>
In the directory,
look at the <tt>BinTree</tt> directory for the basic classes that
define binary trees.  The <tt>Test.java</tt> application shows
how to build some trees and use them as arguments to methods.
The <tt>TreeCalculator.java</tt> class
contains codings of methods that count and print trees.


<h3>Printing a tree's contents: in-order, pre-order, and post-order</h3>

<p>
We might wish to print the contents of a tree's nodes:
<pre>
printNodes( Leaf ) =  nothing to print

printNodes( Node(value, left, right) ) =  printNodes(left);
                                          print the value;
                                          printNodes(right);
</pre>
The printing proceeds by printing the left subtree in its entirety,
followed by the value at the root, followed by the right subtree.
This is called an <em>in-order</em> tree traversal.
In Java,
<pre>
  /** printInOrder prints all the values held within a binary tree;
    *  the tree is traversed left-to-right _in-order_ (value printed in middle)
    * @param t - the tree traversed and printed  */
  public void printInOrder(BinaryTree t)
  { if ( t instanceof Leaf )
         { }  // no value to print
    else // t must be a Node:
         { printInOrder(t.left());   // print nodes in left subtree
           System.out.println( (t.value()).toString() );  // print node's value
           printInOrder(t.right());  // print nodes in right subtree
         }
  }
</pre>

<p>
For example, the tree seen earlier would print like this:
<pre>
5
9
12
15
</pre>

<p>
Here is a variation on the printing:
<pre>
print2( Leaf ) =  nothing to print

print2( Node(value, left, right) ) = print the value;
                                     print2(left);
                                     print2(right);
</pre>
This is called a <em>pre-order</em> traversal and would generate
<pre>
9
5
12
15
</pre>
for the example tree.

<p>
There is a third variation, post-order traversal, which prints a
node's value after the contents of the left and right subtrees are printed.
You should formulate the algorithm for post-order traversal.

<h3>Modifying a tree---building a new tree in terms of an existing one</h3>

Of course, it is always easy to build a new tree using smaller trees
that we have already constructed.  For example,
say that we have this tree:
<pre>
BinaryTree right_subtree = new Node("c", new Leaf(), new Leaf());
</pre>
It is easy to use <tt>right_subtree</tt> to build a larger tree:
<pre>
BinaryTree t = new Node("a", new Leaf(), right_subtree);
</pre>
Tree <tt>t</tt> holds <tt>right_subtree</tt> as its right subtree.

<p>
But the situation get more interesting if we wish to add new ``growth''
in place of one of the leaves already embedded within tree <tt>t</tt>
For example,
say that we wish to revise tree <tt>t</tt> so that its left
subtree, a leaf, is replaced by a node that holds <tt>"b"</tt>.

<h4>First approach: mutable trees</h4>

<p>
It is tempting to wish for
a method, say, <tt>setLeft</tt>, so that we might just say:
<pre>
BinaryTree new_left_subtree = new Node("b", new Leaf(), new Leaf());
t.setLeft(new_left_subtree);
</pre>

<p>
Of course, we can indeed write a <tt>setLeft</tt> method
(and for that matter, a <tt>setRight</tt> method) and add them to
<tt>class Node</tt>:
<pre>
public class Node extends BinaryTree
{ private Object val;
  private BinaryTree left;
  private BinaryTree right;
    ...

  public void setLeft(BinaryTree new_left)
  { left = new_left; }

  public void setRight(BinaryTree new_right)
  { right = new_right; }
}
</pre>
But before we seize on this approach exclusively, we should consider
another, clever way of replacing a subpart of an existing tree.

<h4>Second approach: immutable trees</h4>

<p>
Once again, here is tree <tt>t</tt>:
<pre>
BinaryTree right_subtree = new Node("c", new Leaf(), new Leaf());
BinaryTree t = new Node("a", new Leaf(), right_subtree);
</pre>
Now, we build the <tt>new_left_subtree</tt>, just like before:
<pre>
BinaryTree new_left_subtree = new Node("b", new Leaf(), new Leaf());
</pre>
Now we wish to alter <tt>t</tt> so that its left leaf is replaced by
<tt>new_left_subtree</tt>.
But we do <tt>not</tt> use <tt>setLeft</tt> to alter <tt>t</tt>.
Instead, we <em>rebuild the parts of <tt>t</tt> that rest above
the <tt>new_left_subtree</tt></em> and reuse the other parts:
<pre>
t = new Node(t.value(), new_left_subtree, t.right());
</pre>
This assignment statement assigns a new tree to variable
<tt>t</tt> --- the tree's root value is exactly the root value
that <tt>t</tt> previously held.  Also, the tree's right subtree
is exactly the same subtree that <tt>t</tt> previously held.
<em>But <tt>t</tt>'s old left subtree, the leaf, is forgotten
and <tt>new_left_subtree</tt> is used instead.</em>

<p>
There is no need for a <tt>setLeft</tt> method --- we build a new tree
instead.

<h4>Comparison</h4>

<p>
The first approach, which used a <tt>setLeft</tt> method,
employs <em>mutable trees</em>; the second method, which rebuilds the parts
of the tree that rest above the altered part,
uses
<em>immutable trees</em>.

<p>
What are the comparative aspects of the two approaches?
For mutable trees:
<ul>
<li>
The program maintains only one (big) tree, because the
mutation operations, <tt>setLeft</tt> and <tt>setRight</tt>,
change links in the heap.
<li>
For some activities, e.g., tree balancing (where a new root node must
be installed), the mutations can be done quickly with programming
``tricks'' that cleverly reset a few links.
</ul>

<p>
Here are the important aspects of immutable trees:
<ul>
<li>
A program can 
maintain multiple trees, <em>and the trees can share each other's
substructures.</em>
(This happens in text editing programs and other interactive programs:
the state of the edited document is stored internally as a tree, and when you
make a modification, a new tree is built that shares almost all of the
old tree but also contains the modification you made.   If you press
the ``undo'' button to undo the modification,
the ``current'' tree is forgotten and the
``earlier'' tree is used instead.   The ability to repeatedly
undo is made possible by multiple trees that share huge parts of
each other.)
<li>
In Java, there is no penalty to constantly
building new trees from pieces of other trees --- the Java garbage
collector reclaims those pieces of trees that are discarded and are
unreferenced by the program.
</ul>
We will study how to build both mutable and immutable trees.

<!--
<p>
The next lecture shows how to work with immutable trees, and the lecture
after that handles mutable trees.  Both techniques are worth
learning.
