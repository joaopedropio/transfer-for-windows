<h2>Doubly Linked Lists</h2>

The linked-list implementation of the stack exposes a particular
use of a linked list, namely, as a sequence of cells where we
insert new cells at the rear of the list and also remove cells from
the rear of the list.  Here is a stack where <tt>"a"</tt> was
pushed first, then <tt>"b"</tt>, then <tt>"c"</tt>:
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/list1.jpg">
</pre>
(Note: <tt>top</tt> marks the ``front'' of the list, which is also the
``top'' of the stack.)

<p>
But say that we wish to perform other manipulations of
the list, say,
traverse and print,
using a while-loop, the contents of the list
<em>from rear to front</em>?  Clearly, the linkage structure displayed
above gives us no easy way to do this.

<p>
Similar issues arise with a linked-list implementation
of a queue, e.g.,
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/list2.jpg">
</pre>
Here, we can easily add cells to the rear and remove from the front.
For that matter, we can add cells to the front, if we wished.
But we cannot easily remove cells from the rear --- or the middle,
for that matter --- and we cannot 
traverse the sequence of cells from
rear-to-front.

<p>
When we wish to write operations like these for a linked list:
<ul>
<li>
remove the rear cell
<li>
add/remove a cell in the middle
<li>
traverse the cells from rear to front
</ul>
then we must redesign the list's cells to hold
<em>two</em>
links---a ``next'' link as well as a ``previous'' link; the
result is a <em>doubly-linked list</em>.
Here is a drawing of the above list with double links:
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/list3.jpg">
</pre>
By starting at the <tt>front</tt>, we can use the ``next'' links to
traverse the cells from front to rear, say, to print
<tt>"a" "b" "c"</tt> in order.  By using the <tt>rear</tt> variable,
we can traverse cells from the list's rear, say,
<tt>"c" "b" "a"</tt>.

Here is a coding of <tt>class DoubleCell</tt>, which we use to
construct the cells that hold values, next links, and previous
links:

<pre>FIGURE: cell for doubly linked lists======================================

/** DoubleCell models a cell with double links; it is used to assemble
  *  doubly linked list.  */
public class DoubleCell
{ private Object val;  // value in the cell
  private DoubleCell next;   // the address of the next cell in the list
  private DoubleCell prev;   // the address of the previous cell in the list

  /** Constructor DoubleCell builds a new cell 
    * @param value - the value inserted in the cell
    * @param prevlink - the predecessor cell to this one
    * @param nextlink - the successor cell to this one  */
  public DoubleCell(Object value, DoubleCell prevlink, DoubleCell nextlink)
  { val = value; 
    prev = prevlink;
    next = nextlink;
  }

  /** getVal  returns the value held in the cell  */
  public Object getVal()
  { return val; }

  /** getPrev  returns the address of the previous cell chained to this one */
  public DoubleCell getPrev()
  { return prev; }

  /** getNext  returns the address of the next cell chained to this one */
  public DoubleCell getNext()
  { return next; }

  /** setPrev  resets the address of the predecessor cell to this one
    * @param link - the address of the new predecessor DoubleCell */
  public void setPrev(DoubleCell link)
  { prev = link; }

  /** setNext  resets the address of the successor cell chained to this one
    * @param link - the address of the new successor DoubleCell */
  public void setNext(DoubleCell link)
  { next = link; }
}

ENDFIGURE===============================================================</pre>

The class contains methods that allow the next and previous links to
be reset; this is important for adding and removing cells in a
doubly linked list.

<h3>Application: a double-ended queue</h3>

<p>
We can use <tt>class DoubleCell</tt> to construct various forms of
doubly linked lists.  As a first example,
Here is a <tt>class DEQueue</tt> (a variant of a double-ended queue),
which has the behavior described in
the previous drawing:  values can be inserted and removed from the
front and the
rear of the list, and the contents of the list can be printed from
front-to-rear and from rear-to-front by means of while-loops:
<p>
<table BORDER CELLPADDING=5>
<tr>
<td>
<b><tt>DEQueue</tt></b>
</td>
<td>
models a double-ended queue such that
<br>
  -- objects are added to the front and to the rear of the sequence;
<br>
  -- objects can be removed from the front and rear of the sequence;
<br>
  -- the sequence's contents can be displayed from front to rear and
      from rear to front (that is, in reverse order)  
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>public void addToFront (Object ob)</tt>
</td>
<td>
adds a new object, ob, to the front of this sequence
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>public void addToRear (Object ob)</tt>
</td>
<td>
  adds object, ob,  to the end of this sequence
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>public Object removeFromFront ()</tt>
</td>
<td>
  removes the front object of this sequence and returns it
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>public Object removeFromRear ()</tt>
</td>
<td>
  removes the rear object of this sequence and returns it
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>public String toString ()</tt>
</td>
<td>
  constructs a string representation of the sequence of objects, from front
    to rear, and returns it
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<tt>public String toStringReversed ()</tt>
</td>
<td>
  constructs a string representation of the sequence of objects,
    in reverse order, from rear to front, and returns it
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
The coding of the <tt>DEQueue</tt> is in the Figure below.  
The Figure shows that care must be taken when removing a cell from
the list, because both the previous and next links must be updated
correctly.

<P>
Here is a small example:
Perhaps we construct an empty queue:
<pre>
DEQueue q = new DEQueue();
</pre>
Heap storage looks like this:
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/deq1.jpg">
</pre>
Next, we add <tt>"b"</tt> to the front of the empty queue:
<pre>
q.addToFront("b");
</pre>
The coding of the <tt>addToFront</tt> method
constructs a new <tt>DoubleCell</tt> and links it to variables
<tt>front</tt> <em>and</em> <tt>rear</tt>:
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/deq2.jpg">
</pre>
Next, we add <tt>"c"</tt> to the rear; this resets variable <tt>rear</tt>
and it also resets the <tt>next</tt> attribute of the cell that was
formerly the rear:
<pre>
q.addToRear("c");
</pre>
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/deq3.jpg">
</pre>
Finally, when we add <tt>"a"</tt> to the front,
<pre>
q.addToFront("a");
</pre>
this resets both <tt>front</tt> as well as the <tt>prev</tt> link
of the formerly front cell:
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/deq4.jpg">
</pre>

<p>
If we print <tt>q</tt>, say, by
<pre>
System.out.println(q.toString());
</pre>
We obtain <tt>"abc"</tt>, because the loop inside <tt>toString</tt>
traverses variable <tt>front</tt> and the <tt>next</tt> links inside
the cells --- from <tt>a4</tt> to <tt>a2</tt> to <tt>a3</tt>.

<p>
(By the way, if object <tt>ob</tt> is a string object,
then <tt>ob.toString()</tt> prints the string's value, rather than
the address of the string object in storage.)

<p>
Dually,
<pre>
System.out.println(q.toStringReversed());
</pre>
prints <tt>"cba"</tt>.


<h3>Application: a list with a direct-deletion operator</h3>

<p>
Doubly linked lists are quite useful when a cell in the
<em>middle</em> of the list must be deleted, or when cells must be inserted
into the middle of the list.

<p>
The standard application is a queue for a printer, where a user can
choose to delete their print job from the printer's queue;
the user sends their deletion request, along with a key or ID,
to the print queue, which uses the key to locate and remove the print job.

<p>
Here is an example: We
want a data structure that lets us insert objects into a list,
and whenever we do an insertion, we receive in return a ``key'' to
where the value lives in the list.  Later, we can use this ``key'' to
directly delete the value from the list.

<p>
For example, perhaps we have this list,
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/listd1.jpg">
</pre>
and we are asked to delete cell, <tt>a3</tt>.
To do so,
<ol>
<li>
we copy <tt>a3</tt>'s <tt>next</tt> link into 
<tt>a3</tt>'s predecessor's <tt>next</tt>
<li>
we copy
<tt>a3</tt>'s <tt>prev</tt> link into <tt>a3</tt>'s successor <tt>prev</tt>
</ol>
This gives us
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/listd2.jpg">
</pre>
These two links are reset with these Java-like instructions:
<pre>
DoubleCell delete_me = a3;
delete_me.getPrev().setNext(delete_me.getNext());   // Step 1
delete_me.getNext().setPrev(delete_me.getPrev());   // Step 2
</pre>

<p>
Here is a <tt>class DeleteList</tt> that implements
this behavior.

/** DeleteList models a list that allows deletion of arbitrary elements:

    *   no object in the list. */

    else { delete_me.getNext().setPrev(delete_me.getPrev()); }

    // for safety's sake, erase all links from deleted cell:
    delete_me.setPrev(null);
    delete_me.setNext(null);
  }

ENDFIGURE===============================================================</pre>

This class's <tt>insert</tt> method uses a simple trick: after a
new cell is constructed to hold the value that is inserted, the cell's
address is returned as the ``key'' to the value in the list!   To ensure
that the receiver of the ``key'' does not use the key for unauthorized
alteration of the list, the ``key'' is returned as having data type
<tt>Object</tt>, making it impossible for the receiver
to know the key's true data type and use
any methods belonging to the key.


<p>
When the ``key'' is used as a parameter in a <tt>delete</tt> request to the
<tt>DeleteList</tt>, the ``key'' is recast into the address of the
cell in the list that must be removed.  The <tt>delete</tt> method
must carefully reset the previous and next links in the cells adjacent
to the deleted cell; when the deleted cell is first or last in the
linked list, then either the <tt>front</tt> or <tt>rear</tt> variables
are changed instead.
