<h2>What Is a Data Structure?</h2>

A ``data structure'' is
a ``container'' that holds <em>elements</em>.  A data structure
has methods for
<ul>
<li>
inserting an element 
<li>
retrieving an element
<li>
deleting an element
</ul>
and possibly others.  Arrays are the classic example of data structure,
and one readily sees that the ``insertion'' operation looks like this:
<pre>
<em>dataStructure</em> [ <em>index</em> ] = <em>element</em> ;
</pre>
(it is disguised as an assignment, but it inserts an element into the array),
and the invocation of the retrieval operation looks like this:
<pre>
<em>dataStructure</em> [ <em>index</em> ]
</pre>
More commonly, people design their own data structures with methods
by writing classes.  Here is an example, lifted verbatim from
Chapter 8 of the CIS200 notes.
