<h2>Software development in Java: classes, objects, and packages</h2>

In the previous lecture, we learned that programs are designed with
three components: model and view and controller.

<p>
The Java language is a bit confusing, because there are two
notions for ``component'' --- <em>class</em> and <em>object</em>.
Here is a simplistic explanation:

<ol>
<li>
The program pieces we write are <em>classes</em>.
Each class lives in a file on disk.
<li>
When we start a program, copies of the classes are created in
the computer's primary storage.  The copy in storage is an
<em>object</em>.   It is possible to copy a class into
primary storage more than once, thus constructing multiple objects
from the same class.  (Example: You write a <tt>class LibraryBook</tt>,
and then you start a program that constructs 100 <tt>new LibraryBook(...)</tt>
objects.)
<li>
When we start a program, say
<pre>
java LibraryManager
</pre>
this constructs
a <tt>LibraryManager</tt> object from
<tt>class LibraryManager</tt>.
Within  <tt>LibraryManager</tt>, there might be statements of the form,
<pre>
 ...  new LibraryBook(...)  ...
</pre>
The <tt>new</tt> statement constructs in storage a <tt>LibraryBook</tt> object
from <tt>class LibraryBook</tt>.
In this way, multiple objects are constructed and live in primary storage.

<li>
Before a program starts, there already exist
several prebuilt objects, such as
<tt>System.in</tt> and <tt>System.out</tt>.   A program can use these,
say, as the view component(s) of the application.
<!--
<li>
When we start a program by
<pre>
java Fred 12 abc 3.5
</pre>
the extra information on the command line are <em>program arguments</em>,
which can be used as input by the program's <tt>main</tt> method.
Of course, input can be received by other means as well, e.g.,
interactive input from the command window and input from a graphics
window.
<li>
A class contains <em>fields</em> and <em>methods</em>;
the fields are usually labelled <tt>private</tt> and the
methods are usually labelled <tt>public</tt>.
When one class ``refers'' to another, this means the class invokes
the other's public methods.  We say that the class
<em>sends messages</em> to the other.
<p>
When an object is constructed from a class, the object gets
an exact copy of the fields and methods written inside the class.
-->
</ol>

<p>
To summarize: classes are the components that the programmer
writes and saves on disk; objects are the components that live
in primary storage when the program executes.  If we wish to be
pedantic, we say that the component diagrams
in the previous lecture are <em>object diagrams</em>.

<h3>Software development in Java</h3>

Recall the software
development methodology stated at the end of the previous lecture:
<ol> 
<li>
<em>Requirements:</em>
The program's intended user tells us how she wishes to use the program.
The user must tell us stories and draw pictures that explain the
different ways the program might be used.  Each possible usage is
called a <em>use-case</em>.

<li>
<em>Design:</em> The programmer studies the use-cases 
and applies the knowledge to designing the component structure,
data structure, and control structure of the solution.
Once the program is designed, the programmer does a ``safety check,''
explaining how each use-case executes with the design.

<li>
<em>Implementation and Testing:</em>  The program is written to match
the design, and it is tested to verify that
it behaves correctly.  The testing
usually proceeds in two stages: <em>unit testing</em>, where each
component is tested by itself as much as possible, and <em>integration
testing</em>, where the entire assembled program is tested on the use-caes.
</ol>


Let's study a simple example.


<h3>Case Study: Counting votes</h3>

<p>
You are the Diebold Company, and the state of Ohio has asked you
to write the software for their electronic voting machines for the
2004 US presidential election.  

<h4>I. Requirements</h4>

You  begin by asking the Ohio election
officials to give you examples --- <em>use-cases</em> --- that describe
how the software should behave.
They might give three such use-cases:
<ul>
<li>
``The voter sees an input dialog on the screen; if the voter
votes for Kerry, she types <tt>Kerry</tt> and pushes the dialog's
OK button.   The program remembers the vote.''
<li>
``If the votes wishes to vote for <tt>Bush</tt>, the voter
types <tt>Bush</tt> instead.
<li>
``When all the voters are finished, the election official sees the
input dialog, presses the Cancel button, and the program prints
the vote totals on the display.''
</ul>

<p>
The set of use-cases is almost always incomplete, and the program
designer might propose more of them, e.g.,
``What happens if the voter types <tt>kerry</tt> or <tt>kery</tt>
instead of <tt>Kerry</tt>''?
Rarely does a programmer begin with ``all'' the use-cases, but there
should be enough of them to gain a good understanding of the problem.

<h4>II. Design</h4>

We now apply the design stages described in the previous lecture.

<h4>Component structure</h4>

The vote-counting program fits the usual model-view-controller
structure:
<pre>
<img src="VoteExample/Figs/components2.jpg">
</pre>

The first and most important task is to decide the data structure
that resides in the model.

<h4> Data structure </h4>

The program's job is to total votes, so a table (array) is needed,
where each cell of the array holds the total for one candidate.
Here is a picture:
<pre>
<img src="VoteExample/Figs/votetable.jpg">
</pre>
The programmer might ask: ``Are these all the candidates?''
``Does Ohio allow write-in ballots?''   The answers to these
questions affect the data structure.  For now, we work with the
3-celled array.


<h4>Control structure</h4>

The controller holds the algorithm that controls vote counting.
Simply stated, the algorithm goes
<pre>
1. read and total the votes
2. print the totals
</pre>
We also know that Step 1 must be conducted one vote at a time,
so the details for Step 1 go something like this:
<pre>
1a. read a vote (if there is one to read!  if not, quit Step 1)
1b. if the vote is for Bush (or Kerry or Nader), add one to the appropriate count
1c. repeat Steps 1a and 1b until no more votes to read
</pre>
The outline should list all the actions the program must do, even
if we do not state the details precisely.
Now we are ready to draw the algorithm as a flow chart, which is
a graph that shows the details and ordering.
Here is the flow chart for Steps 1a and 1b:
<pre>
<img src="VoteExample/Figs/flowchart0.jpg">
</pre>
Now, we finish the flow chart by including Steps 1c and 2.
This adds a loop --- a backwards arc --- to the flowchart and
gives us the following:
<pre>
<img src="VoteExample/Figs/flowchart.jpg">
</pre>

When we take a close look at the algorithm, we notice that the
phrase, ``get input,'' which suggests that we should
use a method in the view component to read the vote.
Next, the phrase, ''add one to Bush's count,'' suggests we
should make a method in the model component to add a vote for Bush
(similarly for Kerry and for Nader).   Finally, the phrase,
``print the totals'', suggests there should be a method that gets
the totals (and a method in the output view to print them).

<p>
This suggests we modify the model with some extra methods:
<pre>
<img src="VoteExample/Figs/votetable3.jpg">
</pre>

<h4>Input-output structure</h4>

Whenever possible, we should use pre-built components to handle
input and output.  Since the votes will arrive from an input dialog,
we can use the dialog object that is prebuilt into the Java libraries ---
It is <tt>javax.swing.JOptionPane</tt>.
The output can be printed into a command window, using the
object,  <tt>System.out</tt>.

<h4>Summary of design</h4>

Here is the current picture of our design:
<pre>
<img src="VoteExample/Figs/design2.jpg">
</pre>
The red dashed arrows are added to remind us which steps in the controller's
algorithm
will invoke the methods in the model and the view.
The purple solid arrows are traditional; they summarize the red dashed
arrows by telling us which components
depend on the other components to execute.  (Here, the controller
cannot execute without its model and view, but the model can be
extracted and used without the controller and view, say, in another
application.)

<p>
Now it is time to write the codings of the methods and the coding
of the algorithm.


<h3>III. Implementation</h3>

<p>
It is best to code the model first, because any flaws in the program's
data structures will render the program useless.
Based on our design, here is a coding of the model:
<pre>
package Election2004;
/** VoteTable remembers the votes for the 2004 US Presidential Election */
public class VoteTable
{
  private int[] vote; // holds the votes for the candidates
                      // vote[0] holds Bush's votes
                      // vote[1] holds Kerry's votes
                      // vote[2] holds Nader's votes

  /** Constructor  VoteTable  initializes the table */
  public VoteTable()
  { vote = new int[3]; }  // all cells are automatically set to 0

  /** voteForBush  adds one more vote to Bush's total */
  public void voteForBush()
  { vote[0] = vote[0] + 1; }

  /** voteForKerry adds one more vote to Kerry's total */
  public void voteForKerry()
  { vote[1] = vote[1] + 1; }

  /** voteForNader  adds one more vote to Nader's total */
  public void voteForNader()
  { vote[2] = vote[2] + 1; }

  /** computeTotals reports the votes for the three candidates
    * @return a string that lists the candidates and their votes. */
  public String computeTotals()
  { return   "Bush = " + vote[0] + "\n"
           + "Kerry = " + vote[1] + "\n"
           + "Nader= " + vote[2] + "\n" ; }
}
</pre>
This component should be tested by itself (called <em>unit testing</em>)
as thoroughly as possible.  You can use a Development Environment
(e.g., BlueJ or Eclipse) to do this, or you can write a tester
program, sometimes called a <em>test harness</em>, to do this.
Here is a sample test harness:
<pre>
package Election2004;
public class TestModel
{ public static void main(String[] a)
  { VoteTable t = new VoteTable();

    System.out.println(t.computeTotals());  // all candidates should have 0s

    t.voteForNader(); 
    System.out.println(t.computeTotals());  // Nader should have 1

    t.voteForKerry();
    System.out.println(t.computeTotals());  // Nader and Kerry should have 1

    // etc.
  }
}
</pre>
A test harness should test all the methods of the component, invoked
in all
possible orderings.

<p>
Next,
here is the controller, named <tt>Start</tt>:
<pre>
package Election2004;
import javax.swing.*;
/** Start starts and controls the vote counting. */
public class Start
{ public static void main(String[] a)
  {
    VoteTable table = new VoteTable();   // construct model object

    // tabulate the votes:
    boolean processing = true;
    while ( processing )
          { String s = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(
	                 "Please type the last name of your candidate:");
            if ( s == null )  // did election official press Cancel ?
                 { processing = false; }  // yes, time to quit
            else { if ( s.equals("Bush") )
	              { table.voteForBush(); }
                   else if ( s.equals("Kerry") )
		      { table.voteForKerry(); }
                   else if ( s.equals("Nader") )
		      { table.voteForNader(); }
		   else { } // it's an invalid vote and is lost forever...
                 }
           }
     // total the votes:
     System.out.println( table.computeTotals() );
     System.exit(0);  // terminate program (including graphics components)
  }
}
</pre>
It is a bit difficult to do unit testing on a controller,
since it controls the other parts of the program, but it <em>is</em>
possible to write a dummy version of <tt>VoteTable</tt> for testing
the controller.
The dummy version, called a <em>stub</em> (sorry --- it's a bad name),
might look like this:
<pre>
package Election2004;
/** This is a dummy VoteTable, for testing purposes only. */
public class VoteTable
{ public VoteTable() { }

  public void voteForBush() { System.out.println("B"); }
  public void voteForKerry() { System.out.println("K"); }
  public void voteForNader() { System.out.println("N"); }

  public String computeTotals()
  { return "request to compute totals" }
}
</pre>
There is no intelligence in the dummy version; it is built to let
us see the order in which the controller uses the methods in the model.

<p>
Finally, note that we have used the prebuilt objects,
<tt>javax.swing.JOptionPane</tt> (for dialog input)
and <tt>System.out</tt> (for output to the command window),
so there is no additional programming needed for the view components.

<p>
Now, the application is ready for systems testing and ultimately,
to let the voters of Ohio decide the 2004 US presidential election.


<h3>Java Packages</h3>

<p>
Perhaps you notice that the two components in the case study were
prefixed by the line,
<pre>
package Election2004;
</pre>
This tells the Java compiler that the
two classes ``belong together'', and indeed, they <em>must</em>
be placed in the
same disk folder (directory), named <tt>Election2004</tt>.
Such a folder is called a Java
<em>package</em>.

<p>
Java makes it easy to create and execute a package.

<p>
<em>(Note: If you use the BlueJ IDE, you should read the CIS300 web pages,
<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/bluej.packages.html">
Constructing packages within BlueJ</a> 
and
<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/bluej.command.args.html">
How to use BlueJ to start a main method</a>
to learn how BlueJ lets you
build and execute packages. The notes there might be a bit out of
date, but if you are having problems making packages with BlueJ,
the notes might be useful.)</em>


<p>
The following instructions work with the Java Development Kit
and a command window:
Say that we want to group
the above two classes into a package named <tt>Election2004</tt>:
<ol>
<li>
We create a new folder, named <tt>Election2004</tt>.
<li>
We insert <tt>class Start</tt> and
<tt>class VoteTable</tt> into the folder.
<li>
<em>As the first line of both of the two classes, we insert:</em>
<pre>
package Election2004;
</pre>
</ol>
We must recompile the classes:
<ol>
<li>
Close (exit) folder <tt>Election2004</tt>.
<li>
Compile each class, e.g.,
<pre>
javac Election2004\VoteTable.java
</pre>
(or, if that doesn't work, use)
<pre>
javac -classpath . Election2004\VoteTable.java
</pre>
(The <tt>-classpath .</tt> tells
the Java compiler that the other classes in the package are found where
<tt>VoteTable.java</tt> lives. )
Note the folder name prefixed to the class name.
</ol>
We execute the start-up class of the package in a similar way:
<pre>
java Election2004.Start
</pre>
Note that the folder name is prefixed with a dot to the start-up
class name.

<p>
We can generate an interlinked collection of web pages for the
package with just one <tt>javadoc</tt> command:
<pre>
javadoc Election2004
</pre>

<p>
You can see the <tt>Election2004</tt> package
at
<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/VoteExample">
<tt>http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/VoteExample</tt>
</a>.

<p>
As an exercise, you should copy the two classes to your computer,
make a package, compile it, execute it, and use <tt>javadoc</tt>
to generate its API specification.

<p>
There are several advantages to grouping programs into packages:
<ol>
<li>
Program components that work together are grouped together --- we won't
lose or forget a component.
<li>
Packages can be saved in ``libaries'' and reused.  Indeed, all
the graphics we do with Java programs reuses packages others wrote for us.
<li>
The <tt>javadoc</tt> program can be used to generate a family
of cross-indexed web pages that document all the components in a
package.  The use of <tt>javadoc</tt> makes it possible to
quickly document and redocument systems during design and development.
</ol>

All three items listed above are important.  We have already exploited
Item 2 each time we wrote a program using a graphical user interface ---
when we added
<pre>
import javax.swing.*;
</pre>
at the beginning of the classes we wrote, we were connecting to and
using a package, namely <tt>javax.swing</tt>, that someone else
wrote.

<p>
Indeed, the general pattern for using an already written package, <tt>P</tt>,
in an application is to
<ul>
<li>
Ensure that the package (folder) <tt>P</tt> is on our computer.
<li>
Append to the top of each new component that uses the package,
the statement,
<pre>
import P.*;
</pre>
</ul>
This makes the components in the package available for use.



<!--
<h3>Java interfaces</h3>
When something is built from pieces, the pieces are usually designed
to connect together in some standard way.  Consider an automobile:
Every time a new car is designed, it is designed with parts like
engine, axles, and wheels, and the parts connect together in a standard way.
Computer programs that interact with a user at a keyboard
are designed in a standard way, called
a <em>Model-View-Controller architecture</em> (MVC architecture):
<ul>
<li>
The model part ``models'' the problem to be solved.  For example,
if the program keeps a database of a library's books, then
the model part models the book objects and a ``shelf'' object that
holds the book objects.
<li>
The view part presents a ``view'' of the model on the display that
the user can see and can interact with.  The view gives the user
buttons and text fields to help the user supply input and read
output.
<li>
The controller part ``controls'' the computation that is demanded
by the user's input.
</ul>
