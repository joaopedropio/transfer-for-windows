<h1>Stacks</h1>

<p>
After the array, perhaps the most important
data structure is the <em>stack</em>.  A stack structure restricts
dramatically how elements are inserted, retrieved, and removed:
The most recently inserted element in the stack is the only one that
can be retrieved or removed. 
(Thus, if you wish to retrieve an element inserted 
long ago, you must first remove <em>all</em> the elements that were inserted
after the desired one.)
This strategy of removal and retrieval
is sometimes called, ``last in, first out.''

<p>
A good real-life
example of a stack is the pile of dinner plates that you encounter when you eat
at the local cafeteria:  When you remove a plate from the pile,
you take the plate on the top of the pile. 
But this is exactly the plate that was added (``inserted'') most recently to
the pile by the dishwasher.  If you want the plate at the bottom of the pile,
you must remove all the plates on top of it to reach it.
Another, sadder, example of a stack is the slogan, ``last hired,
first fired,'' which is typically utilized when a company reduces its
work force.   

<p>
Many computer algorithms work best with stacks --- stacks are used for
<ol>
<li>
remembering partially completed tasks, and
<li>
undoing (backtracking from) an action.
</ol>
An example of 1. is described in the next section, where subexpressions
of an arithmetic expression are remembered for later computation.
Another example is presented in the next lecture, where we see how the
Java Virtual Machine uses a stack to remember all of a program's
methods that have been called but are
not yet finished.

<p>
An example of 2. is the ``undo'' button on most text editors, which
lets a person undo a typing error, or the ``back'' button on a web browser,
which lets a user backtrack to a previous web page.  Another example
is a searching algorithm, which searches a maze and keeps a history
of its moves in a stack.  If the algorithm makes a false (bad) move,
the move can be undone by retrieving the previous position from the stack.

<h3>Example: Arithmetic expression evaluation</h3>

<p>
We begin with a
famous example that uses a stack to remember partially completed
computational tasks: Evaluating an arithmetic expression written in postfix
notation (``Lukasiewicz notation''). 

<p>
Postfix notation is an parenthesis-free way of writing arithmetic expressions,
where one
places the
operator symbol <em>after</em>
the operator's two operands.  For example, the addition of 3 to 2 is
written <tt>3 2 +</tt>, and the multiplication of the result by 4 is
written
<tt>3 2 + 4 *</tt>.  Remarkably, <em>parentheses are never needed</em>.
An example like
<pre>
((3 + 2) * 4) / (5 - 1)
</pre>
is written
<pre>
3 2 + 4 * 5 1 - /
</pre>
To see why parentheses are unnecessary, let's manually compute the expression:
<pre>
3 2 + 4 * 5 1 - /
=>   5 4 * 5 1 - /
=>  20 5 1 - /
=>  20 4 /
=> 5
</pre>
We see that an operator evaluates with the two operands that immediately
precede it.  This explains why
the division operator is written
last in the original expression,
because the division is performed only after all the other
subexpressions are evaluated.

<p>
Postfix arithmetic is more than an interesting oddity --- <em>it is the
standard format for writing arithmetic expressions that must be 
executed by a CPU</em>.   Recall that the CPU's arithmetic-logic unit
works with the CPU's registers to do arithmetic.   A CPU cannot
compute the result of the expression,
<tt>((3 + 2) * 4) / (5 - 1)</tt>, but it <em>can</em>
compute the result of
<tt>3 2 + 4 * 5 1 - /</tt>, because the operands and operators are
now arranged in the correct order for loading numbers into registers
and doing the operations.  Here is an assembly code sequence
that tells the CPU how to compute
the postfix expression:
<pre>
loadconst R1 3   // load Register 1 with constant 3
loadconst R2 2   // load Register 2 with constant 2
add R2 R1        // add Register 1 to Register 2
loadconst R1 4   // etc.
multiply  R2 R1
loadconst R1 5
loadconst R3 1
subtract R1 R3
divide R2 R1
</pre>
The register names, R1, R2, R3, are a bit distracting ---
notice the pattern hidden in the instructions (erase the register
names):
<pre>
loadconst 3
loadconst 2
add
loadconst 4
multiply
loadconst 5
loadconst 1
subtract
divide
</pre>
It is exactly the postfix expression!  Indeed, the simplified 
version of the assembly code is called <em>stack code</em> or
<em>byte code</em>,
and it is in fact the format of code embedded in the .class files
constructed by the Java compiler.

<h4>The Java compiler translates programs into posfix notation</h4>

<p>
Because postfix format is ideal for computation with a CPU,
the Java compiler not only checks the grammar of your Java program, it also
translates the program into postfix format --- even
the assignments, conditionals, and loops are reformatted into postfix
format.   If you write a program like this:
<pre>
...
x = x + 1;
if ( x > 2 ) 
   { y = 2 * ( x - 3 ); }
...
</pre>
the Java compiler produces the postfix-reformatted
version:
<pre>
...
x 1 + =x ; 
x 2 > if
    2 x 3 - * =y ;
...
</pre>
and then writes the byte code (stack code) for the postfix version into the
program's .class file:
<pre>
...
load x
loadconst 1
add
storeinto x
load x
loadconst 2
greaterthan
test_and_jump_if_false_to LabelA
loadconst 2
load x
loadconst 3
subtract
multiply
storeinto y
LabelA: ...
</pre>

<p>
The example leaves us with two fundamental questions:
<ul>
<li>
How does the Java Virtual Machine execute the byte code?
<li>
How does the Java compiler convert a Java program into postfix format (byte
code)?
</ul>
Both questions are answered with the assistance of the stack data structure.

<h3>The Java Virtual Machine uses a stack</h3>

A stack is the ideal data structure for evaluating an
arithmetic expression
written in postfix notation.

<p>
Recall again that the postfix version of
<tt>((3 + 2) * 4) / (5 - 1) </tt>
is
<pre>
3 2 + 4 * 5 1 - /
</pre>
Figure 2 illustrates how we might use a stack to compute
the result of this expression --- <em>
the stack holds
the results of subexpressions that are awaiting further computation</em>. 

<p>
In the Figure below,
the stack is drawn as if it were a stack of
dinner plates---it grows vertically.  The arithmetic expression shrinks
horizontally as it is read and computed.

ENDFIGURE===============================================================</pre>

The symbols of the input expression are read, one by one; numerals are
inserted onto the ``top'' of the stack; and operators retrieve
the top two numerals from the
stack, perform the operation, and insert the result onto the stack.

<p>
This is simple and mechanical,
and it is easy to write a computer algorithm
that does the steps:
<pre>
begin with an empty stack and an input stream.
while there is more input to read, do:
   read the next input symbol;
   if it's a numeral, 
      then push it onto the stack;
   if it's an operator
      then pop two numerals from the stack;
           perform the operation on the numerals;
	   push the result;
end while;
// the answer of the expression is waiting for you in the stack:
pop the answer;
</pre>

<p>
Indeed, the algorithm sketched above
<em>forms the heart of the
Java Virtual Machine</em>, which ``reads'' and ``executes'' your Java program.

<p>
Recall that
the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is itself a computer program, whose job
is to read byte code and do the instructions.
As we saw in the previous section, both Java statements as well as expressions
are translated by the Java compiler into byte code.
The JVM reads the byte code instructions, and uses a stack, just like
the one we used in the arithmetic example, to compute the results of
arithmetic expressions.  The stack is sometimes called the
<em>temporary-value stack</em>, because the subresults of arithmetic
expressions are ``temporary'' and the final result is popped and stored
into some variable's storage cell.

<p>
The algorithm for the JVM looks something like this:
<pre>
begin with an empty stack and the byte code.
while there is more byte code to read, do:
   read the next byte-code instruction;
      if it's  loadconst n,
            then push n onto the stack;
      if it's  load x,
            then look up x's value in storage and push it onto the stack;
      if it's an operator
	    then pop two numerals from the stack;
	    perform the operation on the numerals;
	    push the result;
      if it's  store x,
            then pop a numeral and store it in x's cell in storage;
      if it's  test_and_jump_if_false_to LabelL
            then  pop the stack and see if the value is false (0);
	          if it is, reset the JVM's instruction counter to  LabelL
       ... etc. ...
   end while;
</pre>
This algorithm is written in machine code, and it is read and executed
by the CPU.  So, the CPU executes the JVM, which reads and executes
byte code.  It all works well because of a stack!


<h3>Writing one's own stack</h3>

Table 3 specifies the methods one needs for a stack.
<pre>TABLE 3: specification of a stack========================================</pre>

<pre>ENDTABLE=============================================================</pre>
The names, <tt>push</tt>, <tt>pop</tt>, and <tt>top</tt> are traditional;
<tt>isEmpty</tt> is the stack's ``length'' operation.

<p>
A stack can be implemented in various ways; we start with Figure 4,
which uses an array, <tt>s</tt>,
to collect the stack's elements.  An extra variable,
<tt>top</tt>, is used to remember which array element contains the
most recently inserted object.
<pre>FIGURE 4: array-based implementation of stack============================

/** Stack0 models a stack data structure  */
public class Stack0
{ private int INITIAL_SIZE = 5;
  private int top;     // how many elements in the stack
  private Object[] s;  // the stack
         // invariants: elements on stack are  s[top-1] s[top-2] ... s[0]
         //             top  is always in range  0 .. s.length-1

  /** Constructor  Stack0  creates a stack. */
  public Stack0()
  { s = new Object[INITIAL_SIZE]; 
    top = 0; 
  }

  /** push  inserts a new element onto the stack
    * @param ob - the element to be added */
  public void push(Object ob)
  { if ( top == s.length )
         { // array is full---create a new one to hold more objects:
           Object[] temp = new Object[s.length * 2];
           for ( int j = 0;  j != top;  j = j+1 )
               { temp[j] = s[j]; }  // copy elements into  temp
           s = temp;   // set  s  to hold address of  temp
         }
    s[top] = ob;
    top = top + 1;
  }

  /** pop  removes the most recently added element
    * @return the element removed from the stack
    * @exception RuntimeException if stack is empty */
  public Object pop()
  { if ( top == 0 )
       { throw new RuntimeException("Stack error: stack empty"); }
    top = top - 1;
    return s[top];
  }

  /** top  returns the identity of the most recently added element
    * @return the element
    * @exception RuntimeException if stack is empty */
  public Object top()
  { if ( top == 0 )
       { throw new RuntimeException("Stack error: stack empty"); }
    return s[top - 1];
  }

  /** isEmpty  states whether the stack has 0 elements.
    * @return whether the stack has no elements  */
  public boolean isEmpty()
  { return ( top == 0 ); }
}

ENDFIGURE============================================================</pre>

<p>
If we create a stack, <tt>operands</tt>,
from Figure 4 to perform the computation
in Figure 2, the eighth configuration in that Figure would look
like this in computer storage:
<pre>
                  ----
Stack0 operands ==| a1 |
                  ----
 a1 : Stack0
 --------------        ---
 | int INITIAL_SIZE ==| 5 |
 |            ---      ---
 | int top ==| 3 |
 |            -------
 | Object[] s ==| a2 |
 |               ----
 |  ...

  a2 : Object[5]
 --------------
 |    0    1    2     3      4   
 |  -----------------------------
 | | a7 | a8 | a9 | null | null |
 |  -----------------------------

  a7 : Integer         a8: Integer           a9: Integer
 ---------------      --------------        --------------
 | (holds 20)         | (holds 5)           | (holds 1)
</pre>
That is, array <tt>s</tt> holds the addresses of three <tt>Integer</tt>
objects, and <tt>top</tt> remembers that the stack holds three objects.
(Review the section, ``<tt>class Object</tt> and Wrappers,'' in
Chapter 9 to learn why the integers, 20, 5, and 1, must be embedded
into <tt>Integer</tt> objects before they are inserted into the stack.)

<p>
The next step in Figure 2 removes two objects from the stack (using
<tt>pop</tt> twice), does a
subtraction, and inserts a 4 (using <tt>push</tt>).  The resulting
configuration looks like this:
<pre>
                  ----
Stack0 operands ==| a1 |
                  ----
 a1 : Stack0
 --------------        ---
 | int INITIAL_SIZE ==| 5 |
 |            ---      ---
 | int top ==| 2 |
 |            -------
 | Object[] s ==| a2 |
 |               ----
 |  ...

  a2 : Object[5]
 --------------
 |    0    1     2     3      4
 |  -----------------------------
 | | a7 | a10 | a9 | null | null |
 |  -----------------------------

  a7 : Integer         a8 : Integer          a9 : Integer      a10 : Integer
 ---------------      --------------        --------------    --------------
 | (holds 20)         | (holds 5)           | (holds 1)       | (holds 4)
</pre>
Because the value of <tt>top</tt> correctly marks the top of the stack,
there is no need to erase the value in element 2 of the array---this value
will never again be used and will be overwritten if a <tt>push</tt>
is executed next.

<h3>The Java Compiler Uses a Stack</h3>

<p>
A stack is the key data structure for translating a program 
into postfix format (and then, into byte code).

<p>
To keep it simple, think about how we might
translate an infix arithmetic expression,
like
<tt>((3 + 2) * 4) / (5 - 1) </tt>,
into <tt>3 2 + 4 * 5 1 - /</tt>.
This time, the stack holds operator symbols (rather than the operands);
the algorithm goes like this:
<pre>
begin with an empty stack and an input stream.
while there is more input, do:
  read the next input symbol;
  if it's a numeral, 
     then print it to the output filestream;
  if it's an operator,
     then push it onto the stack;
  if it's a '(',
     then discard it;
  if it's a ')',     // marks the end of an expression!
     then pop an operator from the stack and print it
end while;
</pre>
As an exercise, use the algorithm to translate <tt>((3 + 2) * 4) / (5 - 1) </tt>.

<p>
You can see from the algorithm that the parentheses (especially the
right one) plays a critical role in directing stack pops and translation.
This is not an accident --- stacks are used to translate so-called
<em>bracket languages</em>, and both arithmetic and Java are examples
of bracket languages.  

<p>
It is not an accident that Java makes you insert all those tedious
<tt>{</tt> and <tt>}</tt> symbols and punctuation like <tt>;</tt>
and keywords like <tt>class</tt> and <tt>while</tt>.
These are <em>brackets</em> that the Java compiler uses to disassemble
a Java program and rebuild it in postfix form!

<p>
As an exercise, you should try to modify the above algorithm so that
it can translate a baby-Java language of arithmetic, assignments,
and while-loops into postfix format.  If you can do this, you are
very close to writing your own Java compiler.



<h3>Exhaustive Search</h3>

<p>
Stacks are also used to remember the paths that one travels when one
``searches'' through a graph, network, or tree.  Here is a simple
example: Say that you must list all four-letter word permutations of the
letters, <tt>'a', 'b', 'c'</tt> and <tt>'d'</tt>.  To think of the solution
systematically, you might draw a ``tree,'' whose paths show the choices
for a word's first letter, second letter, and so on.
A sketch of the tree appears in Figure 5.
<pre>FIGURE 5: search tree for permutations of "abcd"===========================

                                              "" (empty string)
                                /                   /           \           \

First letter:                a                      b             c           d
                     /       |      \             / | \         / | \        /|\
                    /        |       \           /  |  \
Second letter:     b         c        d        a   c   d        ...         ...
                  / \       / \      / \      / \ / \ / \
                 /   \     /   \    /   \
Third letter:    c   d     b   d    b   c         ...           ...         ...
                 |   |     |   |    |   |
(Last letter:)   d   c     d   b    c   b         ...           ...         ...

ENDFIGURE==============================================================</pre>

<p>
Such a tree is sometimes called a <em>search tree</em>, and the
paths through the tree are called the <em>search space</em>.
(Think about an adventure game where you must open the doors, a, b, c, and d,
and the order in which you open the doors affects the outcome of the game.
The smartest way for a computer to play the game is to study all possible
sequences of moves before making its first move.  The computer
would generate the search tree seen above.)

<p>
To ``search'' the tree for all four-letter permutations, you follow
the paths from the tree's top (its <em>root</em>) to its end points
(it's <em>leaves</em>).

<p>
At the top of the tree, you select one of the four paths to reach a word's
first letter; say that you select the leftmost path, choosing <tt>a</tt>.
This gives you three possible paths to the second letter, and so on.
Of course, to generate all permuations, you must traverse all the
paths of the tree.  Traversal of all paths is simply done with
a stack---as one path is traversed, the stack remembers
the paths that must be explored later.

<p>
Figure 6 illustrates the traversal process, where the stack is drawn on
its side, its ``top'' positioned to the right.
<pre>FIGURE 6: tree traversal that generates permutations=====================

Stack contents        Tree traveral steps
--------------        ------------------------

""                      Start with a stack that holds the empty string.

(empty)                 Pop stack.  The valued popped, "", represents the
                        position at the top of the tree.  Next,
                        extend string, "",  by  a, b, c, d,  and push the
                        resulting four strings:
"d" "c" "b" "a"       

                        Pop stack.  Value  "a"  represents the  a-position in
"d" "c" "b"             the tree.  Extend "a"  with  b, c, d, and push:


"d" "c" "b" "ad" "ac" "ab"

                        Pop stack, extend "ab" by c and d, and push:

"d" "c" "b" "ad" "ac" "abd" abc"

                        Pop stack, and extend "abc" by d, and push:

"d" "c" "b" "ad" "ac" "abd" abcd"

                        Pop stack.  The value popped, "abcd", is a completed
                        string, so output it.

"d" "c" "b" "ad" "ac" "abd"
 
                        Pop stack, and extend "abd" by c, and push:

"d" "c" "b" "ad" "ac" "abdc"

                        Pop stack.  The value popped, "abdc", is a completed
                        string, so output it.

"d" "c" "b" "ad" 
                        Pop stack, extend "ac" by b and d, and push:

"d" "c" "b" "ad" "acd" "acb"

      etc.

ENDFIGURE=============================================================</pre>
The Figure shows that the search traverses the paths of the
tree from left-to-right, completely to the end points (``leaves'').
This form of traversal is called <em>depth-first search</em> because it
descends to the ``depths'' of the tree as quickly as possible.
A stack naturally supports depth-first search.

<p>
Search trees like the one in Figure 5 are used to represent
choices of possible moves in a computer game; a computer ``player''
of say, tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses),
can use such a tree to systematically explore all
sequences of moves and calculate all possible outcomes.  Stacks
help the player remember which move sequences remain to be analyzed.

<p>
Another well-known example of search, called the ``travelling
salesman problem,'' finds the shortest path from
a start city to a destination city 
on a road map; the paths between
cities are summarized as a tree, and a stack helps a program calculate the
total distance travelled in each path from the start city
to the next city
to the next, etc., to the destination.

<p>
A bit of thought will convince you that the search tree itself need not
be constructed when programming a solution
to the travelling salesman problem:
A table that lists adjacent cities and the distances between them
will suffice for building the stack.  (This is also true for the permutation
example, where the letters in the string can be consulted
in place of the search tree.)

<li>
Use a stack to write an application that checks an arithmetic expression
for <em>balanced parentheses</em>, that is,
every left parenthesis is followed in the expression by
a matching right parenthesis.
<li>
A stack is <em>bounded</em> if it is limited to some maximum size.
Revise the constructor in Figure 4 so that receives a parameter that
states the size of the stack, and revise <tt>push</tt> so that it
generates an exception if stack size is exceeded.
<li>
Problems that cannot be done with stack---given 01234...
rearranging only by push, and pop into arb permutation.
Knuth: impossible to build a sequence  v1v2...vn such that
vj < vk < vi  yet  i < j < k  (e.g.,  4123)
<li>
Finish the depth-first search in Figure 6.
<li>
Write an application that prints the permutations calculated by
Figure 6.
