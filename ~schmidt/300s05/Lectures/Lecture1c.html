<h1>Execution Semantics</h1>

How does a computer execute a Java program?
Recall from the lecture on operating systems that the user can
start a program by typing a command in a command window (or, by
clicking an icon on the display, or by clicking a button inside
an IDE).   This causes the OS to find the program on disk,
reserve some primary storage to hold the program and its data,
copy (<em>load</em>) the program into storage,
and ready the program (now called a <em>process</em>) for
execution by the CPU.

<p>
Here is a picture that shows primary storage:

</pre>

<p>
Java programs are more complex to load than C programs, because
a monitoring program, called the <em>Java virtual machine (JVM)</em>
must be loaded into the partition first.
There are (at least) three reasons why the JVM lives in the
partition with your application:
<ul>
<li>
Your application is stored as <tt>.class</tt> files, which are <em>not</em>
machine (binary) code --- the CPU cannot read and execute
their instructions.  When your program executes, the JVM converts the
instructions, one by one as needed, into machine code that the CPU
can execute.  The conversion is called <em>interpretation</em>.
<li>
When a mouse is clicked (or text is typed) as input to your application,
the operating system contacts the JVM, which converts the mouse click
into a Java object and invokes the component of your application that is
awaiting the mouse-click object.
<li>
The Java language allows components to be downloaded
from other computers and copied into an application's storage partition.
The JVM does the work of obtaining the component, checking that it is
indeed a proper Java <tt>.class</tt>-file, and copying it into the
storage partition.
</ul>
The JVM provides flexibility, but it occupies a lot of storage and
its interpretation method is slow.  (This explains why Java is not
a popular language for computationally-expensive tasks, like numerical
computing.)

<p>
Loaded along with the JVM are the contents of
the Java package,
<tt>java.lang</tt>, which contains helper classes
for integers, doubles, strings, etc., as well as <tt>System.in</tt>
and <tt>System.out</tt>.
Finally, the <tt>.class</tt>-files of the user program are loaded.
The storage partition now looks like this:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/layout2.jpg">
</pre>
The remaining storage space, called <tt>heap storage</tt>, will hold
the objects that are constructed when the application executes.

<h3>Syntax and semantics</h3>

A program's
<em>syntax</em> is what the program looks like:
how its words are spelled and how its words are combined into phrases
and sentences.
Every programming language has syntax laws, which state the correct
ways of spelling words and forming sentences.

<p>
For example, in Java,
<pre>
int x = y + 1;
</pre>
has correct syntax, but
<pre>
x int == y 1 +
</pre>
does not.

<p>
The laws of syntax can also extend across separate commands,
making it difficult to learn the precise syntax of a language.
For example, although the command above appears to be proper,
it is <em>not</em> when it is embedded in this sequence:

<pre>
boolean y = false;
int x = y + 1;
</pre>
The issue is that Java requires that its variables be <em>typed</em>,
and the first statement attaches a typing to <tt>y</tt> that makes its
use in the second command improper.   Syntax laws that extend across
commands are called <em>context laws</em>.

<!--
<p>
DELETE:
Context laws also appear in natural languages, like English.
Here is an example, similar to the Java example,
of a context error in English:
<pre>
Ed is my dog.
Ed has wings.
</pre>
Context laws can be difficult to follow:
<pre>
Ed is my dog.
I dressed him as an angel for my Halloween party.
Ed has wings.
</pre>
-->


<p>
The <em>semantics</em> of a program is
what the program means.  Although it is less obvious than syntax,
a program's semantics is crucial.  (Imagine taking a French course
where the instructor makes you write proper-looking French but
does not tell you what the words mean --- this is useless.)

<p>
It is crucial to learn a language's semantics laws alongside its syntax laws. 
Unfortunately,
for complicated programming languages (like Java!), it is tempting to
neglect learning semantics and
use an IDE to ``show'' us what our Java programs mean.
This is a fun game, but we cannot use this approach for any
serious work.
(Imagine learning only the syntax of French, then travelling to Paris
and talking to the policeman at the airport to discover what your
spoken French means --- the approach is inefficient and
will likely lead to an unpleasant outcome.)

<p>
The semantics of a
programming language can be described in several different
ways, but the most common approach, especially for beginners,
is <em>operational semantics</em>, which states how the language's commands
operate when they are executed by a computer.

<p>
In the remainder of this lecture, we describe the operational semantics of
crucial Java commands.  The descriptions are not absolutely precise,
but they are precise enough that they give you an understanding of how
the commands operate so that you can, for yourself, calculate
a similar operational semantics for the programs that you write.

<p>
Your goal should be 
<em> to know what your program
will do before you give the program to the computer to execute.</em>



<h3>A simple example</h3>

We now study the operational semantics of a two-component Java application.
The example shows us what happens when objects are created and
when methods are invoked.

<p>
Here are the two components, a controller and a model:
<pre>
public class Controller
{ public static void main(...)
  { int x = 2;
    Model m = new Model();
    m.set(x+1);
    System.out.println( m.get() );
} }


public class Model
{ private int val;

  public Model() { val = 0; }

  public void set(int w)
  { val = w;
    printIt(); }

  private void printIt() { System.out.println(val); }

  public int get() { return val; }
}
</pre>
The controller constructs the model object and the invokes its
<tt>set</tt> and <tt>get</tt> methods.

<p>
When the program is started, (<tt>java Controller</tt>)
the JVM and <tt>java.lang</tt> are loaded
into the partition.  Then, <tt>Controller.class</tt> and
<tt>Model.class</tt> are loaded, and an object is constructed in heap
storage from
<tt>Controller.class</tt>.

<p>
The JVM manages the execution.  In particular,
it keeps an <em>instruction counter</em>, which remembers which
instruction to execute.
The JVM starts with the first instruction in the <tt>main</tt> method,
which is associated with the
<tt>Controller</tt> object:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1a.jpg">
</pre>
The controller object rests at address
100 (this was chosen arbitrarily for this example), and this is where
we find its associated <tt>main</tt> method.  Within <tt>main</tt>,
two cells are allocated for the method's local
variables, <tt>x</tt> and <tt>m</tt>.
(The cell labelled ``<tt>r.a.</tt>'' will be explained later.)

<p>
The first instruction that executes, at address 102, is <tt>int x = 2</tt>;
it saves 2 in
<tt>x</tt>'s cell:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1b.jpg">
</pre>
The next instruction, at address 103, constructs a new <tt>Model</tt>
object.  Several steps are performed:
<ol>
<li>
A copy of <tt>class Model</tt> in constructed in storage, and cells
for its private variables are allocated therein.
<li>
The object's constructor method is immediately executed.
<li>
The address of the newly constructed object is returned as the ``result''
of executing the constructor method.  
</ol>

The picture below shows Step 1: The object is constructed, a cell is
allocated for its variable, <tt>val</tt>, and
its constructor method is started (the instruction counter in the
JVM is reset to 502, the first instruction in the constructor method.) 

<p>
Notice the cell named <tt>r.a.</tt>,
placed at the end of the constructor method.  This cell holds the
<em>return address</em>, which remembers where the JVM should resume
its execution of <tt>main</tt> once the constructor method finishes:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1c.jpg">
</pre>

Next, Step 2 is the execution of the constructor method, which inserts
0 into <tt>val</tt>'s cell.  Now, the instruction counter has progressed
to address 503, which is the end of the constructor method.  This tells
the JVM that it is time to return:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1d.jpg">
</pre>

The JVM resets its instruction counter with the address in <tt>r.a.</tt>.
This takes it back to executing the <tt>main</tt> method at address 103,
which is
<pre>
m = *
</pre>
Now, it is time for Step 3:
The address of the newly constructed model object, 500, is placed at
*, where it is awaited:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1e.jpg">
</pre>
Notice also that the remains of the constructor method in <tt>Model</tt>
are erased.

<p>
Now, the assignment to <tt>m</tt> can be completed:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1f.jpg">
</pre>

<p>
Next, it is time to execute the method invocation,
<tt>m.set(x+1)</tt>.  The evaluation of the invocation proceeds
from left to right:
<ol>
<li>
determine the target object's (<tt>m</tt>) address.
(Here, it is 500.)
<li>
determine the value of the argument (actual parameter).
Here, it is <tt>3</tt>.
<li>
start the invoked method within the target object.
</ol>
Steps 1 and 2 are shown below:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1g.jpg">
</pre>

And here is the start of Step 3 --- method <tt>set</tt> is activated
within the object at address 500.  Notice that its argument
is saved in a local variable.
As seen before, the return address is saved,
and the instruction counter is reset to the first instruction within the
invoked method:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1h.jpg">
</pre>

The next instruction conducts an assignment, and the instruction that
follows invokes yet another method.  This time, the method is internal
to the object (we know this because there is no target object name, only
a method name):
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1j.jpg">
</pre>

The invocation follows the usual pattern, and the <tt>printIt</tt> method
is activated in the object:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1k.jpg">
</pre>

The method's only instruction is yet another method invocation, this
time to the pre-built object, <tt>System.out</tt>, which is loaded
near the JVM.  The JVM determines that <tt>System.out</tt> lives
at address, say, 46:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1l.jpg">
</pre>
The JVM resets its instruction counter to
start at the first instruction of <tt>System.out</tt>'s
<tt>println</tt> method
(pretend this is at address 48):
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1m.jpg">
</pre>
When <tt>println</tt> finishes, the return address is retrieved, and
the instruction counter is reset to the end of the <tt>printIt</tt>
method:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1n.jpg">
</pre>
This instruction is itself another request to reset the instruction
counter with yet another return address:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1p.jpg">
</pre>
The next instruction, back in <tt>main</tt>, is another method call.
(Indeed, it contains two method calls, so the one to <tt>get</tt>
must be executed before the one to <tt>println</tt> may proceed.)
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1q.jpg">
</pre>
The invocation of <tt>get</tt> operates like the method calls already seen:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex1r.jpg">
</pre>
The rest of the execution is left for you to complete as an exercise.

<h3>An example with multiple instances</h3>

The second example, although short, emphasizes three points:
<ol>
<li>
A program can construct multiple objects from the same class;
<li>
arrays are objects, too;
<li>
variables hold only the addresses of objects and <em>not</em> the
objects themselves.
</ol>

<p>
Here is the coding of a <tt>class Book</tt>, which will be used to
construct multiple book objects that will be saved in a library's
data base:
<pre>
public class Book
{ String title;  String author;

  public Book(String t, String a)
  { title = t;  author = a; }

  ...
}
</pre>
Here is the coding of the database:
<pre>
public class Library
{ Book[] books;  int count;

  public Library(int size)
  { books = new Book[size];  count = 0; }

  public void insert(Book b)
  { books[count] = b;  count = count + 1; }

  public Book borrow(int key)
  { return books[ key % count ]; }
}
</pre>
And here is a simple controller that constructs some books,
places them in the database, and perhaps does some other work:
<pre>
public class Controller
{ public static void main(...)
  { Book b1 = new Book("Tale of Two Cities", "Dickens");
    Book b2 = new Book("Gravity's Rainbow", "Pynchon");
    Library lib = new Library(4);
    lib.insert(b1);
    lib.insert(b2);
     ...  // do additional work
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The Controller is started, and this makes a controller object in the
storage partition:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex2a.jpg">
</pre>
The instruction at address 103 constructs a book object,
as does the one at address 104.  Two books, both generated from
the same <tt>.class</tt> file, live in storage:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex2b.jpg">
</pre>
Next, a Library object is constructed.  We see that the private variable
in the Library object is an array, but in fact, the array is itelf
a separate object, so the private variable holds the <em>address</em>
of the array:
<pre>
<img src="SemanticsEx/ex2c.jpg">
</pre>
Finally, the instructions at address 106 and beyond copy the <em>addresses</em>
of the two Book objects into the cells of the array.
