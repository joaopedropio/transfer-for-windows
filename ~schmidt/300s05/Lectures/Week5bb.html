<h2>Iterative and Recursive Processing of (Singly) Linked Lists</h2>

<p>
The standard way to proces a singly linked list is to traverse
its cells one by one and compute on each one.
Once again, here is <tt>class Cell</tt>:
<pre>
public class Cell
{ private Object val;  // value in the cell
  private Cell next;   // the address of the next cell in the list

  public Cell(Object value, Cell link)
  { val = value; next = link; }

  public Object getVal() { return val; }

  public Cell getNext() { return next; }

  public void setNext(Cell link) { next = link; }
}
</pre>
and here is the standard iterative pattern for traversing and processing
all the cells in a list, <tt>l</tt>:
<pre>
Cell current = l;
while ( current != null )
      { "process Cell  current";
        current = current.getNext();
      }
</pre>

<p>
We now use the iterative pattern in a method 
that counts the number of cells in a linked
list.  Let <tt>l</tt> be the address of the leading cell
in the list to be counted:
<pre>
/** lengthOf calculates the number of cells in a linked list
  * @param l - the leading cell of the list
  * @return the length of the linked list  */
public int lengthOf(Cell l)
{ int length = 0;
  Cell c = l;
  while ( c != null )
      // invariant: 
      //   lengthOf(l) == length + lengthOf(c)
        { length = length +1;
          c = c.getNext();
        }
 return length;
}
</pre>
The loop uses variable <tt>c</tt> to ''leap'' from cell to cell,
using the links held in the cells.  Variable
<tt>length</tt> is incremented each time <tt>c</tt> makes a leap.

<p>
The loop makes good sense to us, because we think of a linked
list as a sequence of distinct cells that are linked together:
<pre>
front    Cell--+---+    Cell--+---+    Cell--+------+
| o-|--> | "a" | o-|--> | "b" | o-|--> | "c" | null |
+---+    +-----+---+    +-----+---+    +-----+------+
</pre>
So, it is easy to see that <tt>lengthOf(front)</tt> returns 3 as its answer.

<p>
In the above coding of <tt>lengthOf</tt>,
there is an invariant assertion inserted
inside the while loop.
Recall that an invariant documents what the loop is doing
while it iterates its body over and over.

<p>
Take a close look at it:
<pre>
// invariant:  lengthOf(l) == length + lengthOf(c)
</pre>
(Remember--- <tt>l</tt> is the front cell of the entire list,
and <tt>c</tt> is the cell reached part way through the traversal.)
What does it say?
<dl>
<dd>
<em>
The total quantity of cells in the list headed by <tt>l</tt> --- the
<tt>lengthOf l</tt> --- is exactly the sum of the number of cells
counted so far (as remembered by <tt>length</tt>) plus the
quantity of cells in the list headed by <tt>c</tt>, namely, the remainder
of the list that is yet to be counted, the <tt>lengthOf c</tt>!
</em>
</dl>
The invariant uses a ``recursion'' to make its point that, to compute
the length of a complete list, the loop must compute the length of
the list's suffixes.

<p>
This invariant
suggests that there is a recursion in the basic notion
of traversing the loop.  Indeed, 
<em>because <tt>class Cell</tt> is defined in terms of itself</em>,
a simpler solution to the above problem is written with a recursively
defined method:
<pre>
/** lengthOf calculates the number of cells in a linked list
  * @param l - the leading cell of the list
  * @return the length of the linked list  */
public int lengthOf(Cell l)
{ int length = 0;
  if ( l == null )
       { length = 0; }  // an empty list has length 0
  else // the list is nonempty, so count its cells:
       { // Calculate the length of the list that
         //   follows the lead cell, l:
         Cell suffix = l.getNext();
         length = lengthOf(suffix);
         // now, add one for  l's  cell:
         length = length + 1;
       }
  return length;
}
</pre>
The method is based on the natural and obviously correct notion that
the length of a linked list is the length of the lead cell (namely, 1)
added to length of the rest of the list.

<p>
Here is a more terse restatement of the method:
<pre>
  public int lengthOf(Cell l)
  { int length = 0;
    if ( l == null )
         { length = 0; }
    else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
    return length;
  }
</pre>
Remember that when a method ``restarts'' itself via a recursion,
<em>a new copy of the method is activated</em>.  This idea is developed
in the next lecture.

<p>
The recursion in <tt>lengthOf</tt> suggests that a list is a ``nested''
or ``layered'' structure, which we might draw like this:
<pre>
Cell-----------------------+
|     "a"                  |
|     Cell--------------+  |
|     |    "b"          |  |
|     |    Cell-------+ |  |
|     |    |    "c"   | |  |
|     |    |    null  | |  |
|     |    +----------+ |  |
|     +-----------------+  |
+--------------------------+
</pre>

The ``layers'' are implied by
the internal structure
of <tt>class Cell</tt>:
<pre>
public class Cell
{ private Object value;
  private Cell next;  // this is another, smaller list embedded in this one
   ...
  public Object getVal() { return value; }
  public Object getnext() { return next; }
}
</pre>
Notice the ``recursive'' reference to <tt>Cell</tt> within
<tt>class Cell</tt> --- it suggests that another list is nested or layered
inside the Cell that holds the front <tt>value</tt>.

<p>
Of course, we have studied heap-storage layout
well enough to know that field <tt>next</tt> holds the address
of an object that happens to be also a <tt>Cell</tt> object.
But the idea is intriguing: In concept, can a Cell hold inside itself
another Cell?  If we answer ``yes'' to this question, we move from
the world of ``iterative'' data structures to the world
of ``recursive'' (``inductive'') ones.
