<h2>Iterative and Recursive Processing of Linked Lists: Execution Traces</h2>

<p>
We can best understand the loop invariant of method <tt>lengthOf</tt>
if we check it against an execution trace of the method's invocation.
Again, here is the method:
<pre>
public int lengthOf(Cell l)
{ int length = 0;
  Cell c = l;
  while ( c != null )
      //   lengthOf(l) == length + lengthOf(c)
        { length = length +1;
          c = c.getNext();
        }
 return length;
}
</pre>
Say we have this list:
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/listex.jpg">
</pre>
and we wish to compute the result of <tt>lengthOf(a1)</tt>.
The method is entered, and upon entry to the loop, its variables like this:
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/loop1.jpg">
</pre>
We easily verify that the invariant holds after zero loop iterations:
<pre>
 lengthOf(l) == length + lengthOf(c)
</pre>
because <tt>length == 0</tt> and <tt>lengthOf(a1)</tt> should, in principle,
compute to 3.

<p>
The first loop iteration counts the leading cell of the list:
<pre>
length = length +1;
c = c.getNext();
</pre>
and we have
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/loop2.jpg">
</pre>
and again, <tt>lengthOf(l) == length + lengthOf(c)</tt> holds,
because <tt>length == 1</tt> and <tt>lengthOf(a2)</tt> should
compute to 2.

<p>
The next loop iteration gives us
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/loop3.jpg">
</pre>
and then we encounter
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/loop4.jpg">
</pre>
Which causes the loop to halt.
We confirm that
<pre>
 lengthOf(l) == length + lengthOf(c)
</pre>
because <tt>length == 3</tt> and <tt>lengthOf(null)</tt> is of course 0.

<h3>Execution trace of recursive processing</h3>

Here is the recursively defined method for computing length:
<pre>
/** lengthOf  returns the length of list  l  */
public int lengthOf(Cell l)
{ int length;
  if ( l == null )
       { length = 0; }
  else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
  return length;
}
</pre>
And again, here is the list to be processed:
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/listex.jpg">
</pre>
An execution trace of <tt>lengthOf(a1)</tt> must be drawn with
the activation-record stack of the Java Virtual Machine.
Here is the stack when the method starts:

<p>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/stack1.jpg">

The activation record shows that list <tt>a1</tt> must be counted.
Because the list is non-null, the method's else-arm must be computed:
<pre>
else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
</pre>
This computes to
<pre>
length = 1 + lengthOf(a2)
</pre>
The recursive invocation starts a new copy of <tt>lengthOf</tt>, and a
second activation record appears:
<p>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/stack2.jpg">
The picture shows that the result of calculating the length of list
<tt>a2</tt> will be returned to the calling method, which uses it to
calculate the length of list <tt>a1</tt>.

<p>
Because <tt>a2</tt> is non-null, the else-arm is again computed, generating
a third recursive call:
<p>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/stack3.jpg">
The pattern of recursions is now established, and the next recursion
generates this stack:
<p>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/stack4.jpg">
<tt>null</tt> denotes an empty list, which has length 0.
The result, 0, is returned to its caller:
<p>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/stack5.jpg">
The caller can now compute the length of list <tt>a3</tt> ---
it is 1:
<p>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/stack6.jpg">
Now that <tt>a3</tt>'s length is computed, it is returned to its caller:
<p>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/stack7.jpg">
and finally, we have the result for <tt>a1</tt>:
<p>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/stack8.jpg">

<h3>Calculating the recursions without the stack</h3>

The activation-record stack shows how the JVM remembers the history
of recursions in its calculation of the length of list <tt>a1</tt>.
But we can do a ``hand trace'' of the recursions without drawing the stack.

<p>
We do a kind of calculational arithmetic --- ``algebra'' --- on
the method by drawing levels of recursion as a kind of stairstep:
<pre>
initial invocation
  |
  +--> recursive invocation
         |
         + --> another recursion
                 |
                 etc.
</pre>
The ``steps'' represent the activation records on the JVM stack.
When a recursion returns an answer, we insert the answer at the
source of the stairstep arrow.

<p>
Once again, here is the three-celled list:
<pre>
<img src="DoubleLinkFigs/listex.jpg">
</pre>
and here is the recursively defined method:
<pre>
/** lengthOf  returns the length of list  l  */
public int lengthOf(Cell l)
{ int length;
  if ( l == null )
       { length = 0; }
  else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
  return length;
}
</pre>
We will hand draw the computation history triggered by
<tt>lengthOf(a1)</tt>:
<pre>
lengthOf(a1)           // start with initial invocation
 |
 |                     // draw underneath it the method's coding
 +-> Cell l = a1;     // write a variable declaration for the parameter
     int length;
     if ( l == null )
          { length = 0; }
     else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
     return length;
      |              // write computation steps one by one, if you wish:
      V
     Cell l = a1;
     int length;
     if ( false )
        { length = 0; }
     else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
     return length;
      |
      V
     Cell l = a1;
     int length;
     length = 1
            + lengthOf(l.getNext());
     return length; |                  // a recursion:
                    |
                    +-> Cell l = a2;
                        int length;
                        if ( l == null )
                           { length = 0; }
                        else { length = 1
                               + lengthOf(l.getNext()); }
                        return length;
                         |
                         V
                        Cell l = a2;
                        int length;
                        length = 1
                          + lengthOf(l.getNext()); //B
                        return length; |
                                       |
                                       +-> Cell l = a3;
                                           int length;
                                           if  ... // etc.
                                           return length;
                                            |
                                            .
                                            |
                                            V
                                           length = 1
                                            + lengthOf(l.getNext()); //A
                                           return length; |
                                                          |
                                                          +-->
                                                            Cell l = null;
                                                            int length;
                                                            if ( l == null )
                                                             { length = 0; }
                                                            return length;
                                                             |
                                                             V
                                                            return 0;
</pre>
At this point, the 0 is returned to the source point of the invoking
stairstep arrow (see the line marked //A).

<p>
This causes <tt>length</tt> at point //A to compute to 1, which is
returned to point //B.  In this way, we can track by hand the progress
of the recursions without confusing the multiple copies of local
variables, <tt>length</tt>.
